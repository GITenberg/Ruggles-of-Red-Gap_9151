    <h2>
      CHAPTER ONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      At 6:30 in our Paris apartment I had finished the Honourable George,
      performing those final touches that make the difference between a man well
      turned out and a man merely dressed. In the main I was not dissatisfied.
      His dress waistcoats, it is true, no longer permit the inhalation of
      anything like a full breath, and his collars clasp too closely. (I have
      always held that a collar may provide quite ample room for the throat
      without sacrifice of smartness if the depth be at least two and one
      quarter inches.) And it is no secret to either the Honourable George or
      our intimates that I have never approved his fashion of beard, a reddish,
      enveloping, brushlike affair never nicely enough trimmed. I prefer,
      indeed, no beard at all, but he stubbornly refuses to shave, possessing a
      difficult chin. Still, I repeat, he was not nearly impossible as he now
      left my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dining with the Americans,&rdquo; he remarked, as I conveyed the hat, gloves,
      and stick to him in their proper order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;And might I suggest, sir, that your choice be a
      grilled undercut or something simple, bearing in mind the undoubted
      effects of shell-fish upon one&rsquo;s complexion?&rdquo; The hard truth is that after
      even a very little lobster the Honourable George has a way of coming out
      in spots. A single oyster patty, too, will often spot him quite all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What cheek! Decide that for myself,&rdquo; he retorted with a lame effort at
      dignity which he was unable to sustain. His eyes fell from mine. &ldquo;Besides,
      I&rsquo;m almost quite certain that the last time it was the melon. Wretched
      things, melons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as if to divert me, he rather fussily refused the correct evening
      stick I had chosen for him and seized a knobby bit of thornwood suitable
      only for moor and upland work, and brazenly quite discarded the gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feel a silly fool wearing gloves when there&rsquo;s no reason!&rdquo; he exclaimed
      pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, sir,&rdquo; I replied, freezing instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t play the juggins,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Let me be comfortable. And I
      don&rsquo;t mind telling you I stand to win a hundred quid this very evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; I replied. The sum was more than needed, but I had cause to
      be thus cynical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the American Johnny with the eyebrows,&rdquo; he went on with a quite
      pathetic enthusiasm. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re to play their American game of poker&mdash;drawing
      poker as they call it. I&rsquo;ve watched them play for near a fortnight. It&rsquo;s
      beastly simple. One has only to know when to bluff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred pounds, yes, sir. And if one loses&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flashed me a look so deucedly queer that it fair chilled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy you&rsquo;ll be even more interested than I if I lose,&rdquo; he remarked in
      tones of a curious evenness that were somehow rather deadly. The words
      seemed pregnant with meaning, but before I could weigh them I heard him
      noisily descending the stairs. It was only then I recalled having noticed
      that he had not changed to his varnished boots, having still on his feet
      the doggish and battered pair he most favoured. It was a trick of his to
      evade me with them. I did for them each day all that human boot-cream
      could do, but they were things no sensitive gentleman would endure with
      evening dress. I was glad to reflect that doubtless only Americans would
      observe them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So began the final hours of a 14th of July in Paris that must ever be
      memorable. My own birthday, it is also chosen by the French as one on
      which to celebrate with carnival some one of those regrettable events in
      their own distressing past.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin with, the day was marked first of all by the breezing in of his
      lordship the Earl of Brinstead, brother of the Honourable George, on his
      way to England from the Engadine. More peppery than usual had his lordship
      been, his grayish side-whiskers in angry upheaval and his inflamed words
      exploding quite all over the place, so that the Honourable George and I
      had both perceived it to be no time for admitting our recent financial
      reverse at the gaming tables of Ostend. On the contrary, we had gamely
      affirmed the last quarter&rsquo;s allowance to be practically untouched&mdash;a
      desperate stand, indeed! But there was that in his lordship&rsquo;s manner to
      urge us to it, though even so he appeared to be not more than half
      deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good greening me!&rdquo; he exploded to both of us. &ldquo;Tell in a flash&mdash;gambling,
      or a woman&mdash;typing-girl, milliner, dancing person, what, what! Guilty
      faces, both of you. Know you too well. My word, what, what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again we stoutly protested while his lordship on the hearthrug rocked in
      his boots and glared. The Honourable George gamely rattled some loose coin
      of the baser sort in his pockets and tried in return for a glare of
      innocence foully aspersed. I dare say he fell short of it. His histrionic
      gifts are but meagre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fools, quite fools, both of you!&rdquo; exploded his lordship anew. &ldquo;And, make
      it worse, no longer young fools. Young and a fool, people make excuses.
      Say, &lsquo;Fool? Yes, but so young!&rsquo; But old and a fool&mdash;not a word to
      say, what, what! Silly rot at forty.&rdquo; He clutched his side-whiskers with
      frenzied hands. He seemed to comb them to a more bristling rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare say you&rsquo;ll both come croppers. Not surprise me. Silly old George,
      course, course! Hoped better of Ruggles, though. Ruggles different from
      old George. Got a brain. But can&rsquo;t use it. Have old George wed to a
      charwoman presently. Hope she&rsquo;ll be a worker. Need to be&mdash;support you
      both, what, what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I mean to say, he was coming it pretty thick, since he could not have
      forgotten that each time I had warned him so he could hasten to save his
      brother from distressing mésalliances. I refer to the affair with the
      typing-girl and to the later entanglement with a Brixton milliner
      encountered informally under the portico of a theatre in Charing Cross
      Road. But he was in no mood to concede that I had thus far shown a
      scrupulous care in these emergencies. Peppery he was, indeed. He gathered
      hat and stick, glaring indignantly at each of them and then at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greened me fair, haven&rsquo;t you, about money? Quite so, quite so! Not hear
      from you then till next quarter. No telegraphing&mdash;no begging letters.
      Shouldn&rsquo;t a bit know what to make of them. Plenty you got to last. Say so
      yourselves.&rdquo; He laughed villainously here. &ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; said he, and was
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Nevil been annoyed by something,&rdquo; said the Honourable George after a
      long silence. &ldquo;Know the old boy too well. Always tell when he&rsquo;s been
      annoyed. Rather wish he hadn&rsquo;t been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we had come to the night of this memorable day, and to the Honourable
      George&rsquo;s departure on his mysterious words about the hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, I began to meditate profoundly. It was the closing of a day I
      had seen dawn with the keenest misgiving, having had reason to believe it
      might be fraught with significance if not disaster to myself. The year
      before a gypsy at Epsom had solemnly warned me that a great change would
      come into my life on or before my fortieth birthday. To this I might have
      paid less heed but for its disquieting confirmation on a later day at a
      psychic parlour in Edgware Road. Proceeding there in company with my
      eldest brother-in-law, a plate-layer and surfaceman on the Northern (he
      being uncertain about the Derby winner for that year), I was told by the
      person for a trifle of two shillings that I was soon to cross water and to
      meet many strange adventures. True, later events proved her to have been
      psychically unsound as to the Derby winner (so that my brother-in-law, who
      was out two pounds ten, thereby threatened to have an action against her);
      yet her reference to myself had confirmed the words of the gypsy; so it
      will be plain why I had been anxious the whole of this birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one thing, I had gone on the streets as little as possible, though I
      should naturally have done that, for the behaviour of the French on this
      bank holiday of theirs is repugnant in the extreme to the sane English
      point of view&mdash;I mean their frivolous public dancing and marked
      conversational levity. Indeed, in their soberest moments, they have too
      little of British weight. Their best-dressed men are apparently turned out
      not by menservants but by modistes. I will not say their women are without
      a gift for wearing gowns, and their chefs have unquestionably got at the
      inner meaning of food, but as a people at large they would never do with
      us. Even their language is not based on reason. I have had occasion, for
      example, to acquire their word for bread, which is &ldquo;pain.&rdquo; As if that were
      not wild enough, they mispronounce it atrociously. Yet for years these
      people have been separated from us only by a narrow strip of water!
    </p>
    <p>
      By keeping close to our rooms, then, I had thought to evade what of evil
      might have been in store for me on this day. Another evening I might have
      ventured abroad to a cinema palace, but this was no time for daring, and I
      took a further precaution of locking our doors. Then, indeed, I had no
      misgiving save that inspired by the last words of the Honourable George.
      In the event of his losing the game of poker I was to be even more
      concerned than he. Yet how could evil come to me, even should the American
      do him in the eye rather frightfully? In truth, I had not the faintest
      belief that the Honourable George would win the game. He fancies himself a
      card-player, though why he should, God knows. At bridge with him every
      hand is a no-trumper. I need not say more. Also it occurred to me that the
      American would be a person not accustomed to losing. There was that about
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once I had deplored this rather Bohemian taste of the Honourable
      George which led him to associate with Americans as readily as with
      persons of his own class; and especially had I regretted his intimacy with
      the family in question. Several times I had observed them, on the occasion
      of bearing messages from the Honourable George&mdash;usually his
      acceptance of an invitation to dine. Too obviously they were rather a
      handful. I mean to say, they were people who could perhaps matter in their
      own wilds, but they would never do with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their leader, with whom the Honourable George had consented to game this
      evening, was a tall, careless-spoken person, with a narrow, dark face
      marked with heavy black brows that were rather tremendous in their effect
      when he did not smile. Almost at my first meeting him I divined something
      of the public man in his bearing, a suggestion, perhaps, of the confirmed
      orator, a notion in which I was somehow further set by the gesture with
      which he swept back his carelessly falling forelock. I was not surprised,
      then, to hear him referred to as the &ldquo;Senator.&rdquo; In some unexplained
      manner, the Honourable George, who is never as reserved in public as I
      could wish him to be, had chummed up with this person at one of the
      race-tracks, and had thereafter been almost quite too pally with him and
      with the very curious other members of his family&mdash;the name being
      Floud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wife might still be called youngish, a bit florid in type, plumpish,
      with yellow hair, though to this a stain had been applied, leaving it in
      deficient consonance with her eyebrows; these shading grayish eyes that
      crackled with determination. Rather on the large side she was, forcible of
      speech and manner, yet curiously eager, I had at once detected, for the
      exactly correct thing in dress and deportment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining member of the family was a male cousin of the so-called
      Senator, his senior evidently by half a score of years, since I took him
      to have reached the late fifties. &ldquo;Cousin Egbert&rdquo; he was called, and it
      was at once apparent to me that he had been most direly subjugated by the
      woman whom he addressed with great respect as &ldquo;Mrs. Effie.&rdquo; Rather a
      seamed and drooping chap he was, with mild, whitish-blue eyes like a
      porcelain doll&rsquo;s, a mournfully drooped gray moustache, and a grayish
      jumble of hair. I early remarked his hunted look in the presence of the
      woman. Timid and soft-stepping he was beyond measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the impressions I had been able to glean of these altogether
      queer people during the fortnight since the Honourable George had so
      lawlessly taken them up. Lodged they were in an hotel among the most
      expensive situated near what would have been our Trafalgar Square, and I
      later recalled that I had been most interestedly studied by the so-called
      &ldquo;Mrs. Effie&rdquo; on each of the few occasions I appeared there. I mean to say,
      she would not be above putting to me intimate questions concerning my term
      of service with the Honourable George Augustus Vane-Basingwell, the
      precise nature of the duties I performed for him, and even the exact sum
      of my honourarium. On the last occasion she had remarked&mdash;and too
      well I recall a strange glitter in her competent eyes&mdash;&ldquo;You are just
      the man needed by poor Cousin Egbert there&mdash;you could make something
      of him. Look at the way he&rsquo;s tied that cravat after all I&rsquo;ve said to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The person referred to here shivered noticeably, stroked his chin in a
      manner enabling him to conceal the cravat, and affected nervously to be
      taken with a sight in the street below. In some embarrassment I withdrew,
      conscious of a cold, speculative scrutiny bent upon me by the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I have seemed tedious in my recital of the known facts concerning these
      extraordinary North American natives, it will, I am sure, be forgiven me
      in the light of those tragic developments about to ensue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, let me be pictured as reposing in fancied security from all evil
      predictions while I awaited the return of the Honourable George. I was
      only too certain he would come suffering from an acute acid dyspepsia, for
      I had seen lobster in his shifty eyes as he left me; but beyond this I
      apprehended nothing poignant, and I gave myself up to meditating
      profoundly upon our situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankly, it was not good. I had done my best to cheer the Honourable
      George, but since our brief sojourn at Ostend, and despite the almost
      continuous hospitality of the Americans, he had been having, to put it
      bluntly, an awful hump. At Ostend, despite my remonstrance, he had staked
      and lost the major portion of his quarter&rsquo;s allowance in testing a system
      at the wheel which had been warranted by the person who sold it to him in
      London to break any bank in a day&rsquo;s play. He had meant to pause but
      briefly at Ostend, for little more than a test of the system, then proceed
      to Monte Carlo, where his proposed terrific winnings would occasion less
      alarm to the managers. Yet at Ostend the system developed such grave
      faults in the first hour of play that we were forced to lay up in Paris to
      economize.
    </p>
    <p>
      For myself I had entertained doubts of the system from the moment of its
      purchase, for it seemed awfully certain to me that the vendor would have
      used it himself instead of parting with it for a couple of quid, he being
      in plain need of fresh linen and smarter boots, to say nothing of the
      quite impossible lounge-suit he wore the night we met him in a cab shelter
      near Covent Garden. But the Honourable George had not listened to me. He
      insisted the chap had made it all enormously clear; that those
      mathematical Johnnies never valued money for its own sake, and that we
      should presently be as right as two sparrows in a crate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fearfully annoyed I was at the dénouement. For now we were in Paris,
      rather meanly lodged in a dingy hotel on a narrow street leading from what
      with us might have been Piccadilly Circus. Our rooms were rather a good
      height with a carved cornice and plaster enrichments, but the furnishings
      were musty and the general air depressing, notwithstanding the effect of a
      few good mantel ornaments which I have long made it a rule to carry with
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then had come the meeting with the Americans. Glad I was to reflect that
      this had occurred in Paris instead of London. That sort of thing gets
      about so. Even from Paris I was not a little fearful that news of his
      mixing with this raffish set might get to the ears of his lordship either
      at the town house or at Chaynes-Wotten. True, his lordship is not
      over-liberal with his brother, but that is small reason for affronting the
      pride of a family that attained its earldom in the fourteenth century.
      Indeed the family had become important quite long before this time, the
      first Vane-Basingwell having been beheaded by no less a personage than
      William the Conqueror, as I learned in one of the many hours I have been
      privileged to browse in the Chaynes-Wotten library.
    </p>
    <p>
      It need hardly be said that in my long term of service with the Honourable
      George, beginning almost from the time my mother nursed him, I have
      endeavoured to keep him up to his class, combating a certain laxness that
      has hampered him. And most stubborn he is, and wilful. At games he is
      almost quite a duffer. I once got him to play outside left on a hockey
      eleven and he excited much comment, some of which was of a favourable
      nature, but he cares little for hunting or shooting and, though it is
      scarce a matter to be gossiped of, he loathes cricket. Perhaps I have
      disclosed enough concerning him. Although the Vane-Basingwells have quite
      almost always married the right people, the Honourable George was beyond
      question born queer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, in the matter of marriage, he was difficult. His lordship, having
      married early into a family of poor lifes, was now long a widower, and
      meaning to remain so he had been especially concerned that the Honourable
      George should contract a proper alliance. Hence our constant worry lest he
      prove too susceptible out of his class. More than once had he shamefully
      funked his fences. There was the distressing instance of the Honourable
      Agatha Cradleigh. Quite all that could be desired of family and dower she
      was, thirty-two years old, a bit faded though still eager, with the rather
      immensely high forehead and long, thin, slightly curved Cradleigh nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honourable George at his lordship&rsquo;s peppery urging had at last
      consented to a betrothal, and our troubles for a time promised to be over,
      but it came to precisely nothing. I gathered it might have been because
      she wore beads on her gown and was interested in uplift work, or that she
      bred canaries, these birds being loathed by the Honourable George with
      remarkable intensity, though it might equally have been that she still
      mourned a deceased fiancé of her early girlhood, a curate, I believe,
      whose faded letters she had preserved and would read to the Honourable
      George at intimate moments, weeping bitterly the while. Whatever may have
      been his fancied objection&mdash;that is the time we disappeared and were
      not heard of for near a twelvemonth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wondering now I was how we should last until the next quarter&rsquo;s allowance.
      We always had lasted, but each time it was a different way. The Honourable
      George at a crisis of this sort invariably spoke of entering trade, and
      had actually talked of selling motor-cars, pointing out to me that even
      certain rulers of Europe had frankly entered this trade as agents. It
      might have proved remunerative had he known anything of motor-cars, but I
      was more than glad he did not, for I have always considered machinery to
      be unrefined. Much I preferred that he be a company promoter or something
      of that sort in the city, knowing about bonds and debentures, as many of
      the best of our families are not above doing. It seemed all he could do
      with propriety, having failed in examinations for the army and the church,
      and being incurably hostile to politics, which he declared silly rot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sharply at midnight I aroused myself from these gloomy thoughts and
      breathed a long sigh of relief. Both gipsy and psychic expert had failed
      in their prophecies. With a lightened heart I set about the preparations I
      knew would be needed against the Honourable George&rsquo;s return. Strong in my
      conviction that he would not have been able to resist lobster, I made
      ready his hot foot-bath with its solution of brine-crystals and put the
      absorbent fruit-lozenges close by, together with his sleeping-suit, his
      bed-cap, and his knitted night-socks. Scarcely was all ready when I heard
      his step.
    </p>
    <p>
      He greeted me curtly on entering, swiftly averting his face as I took his
      stick, hat, and top-coat. But I had seen the worst at one glance. The
      Honourable George was more than spotted&mdash;he was splotchy. It was as
      bad as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lobster <i>and</i> oysters,&rdquo; I made bold to remark, but he affected not
      to have heard, and proceeded rapidly to disrobe. He accepted the foot-bath
      without demur, pulling a blanket well about his shoulders, complaining of
      the water&rsquo;s temperature, and demanding three of the fruit-lozenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not what you think at all,&rdquo; he then said. &ldquo;It was that cursed bar-le-duc
      jelly. Always puts me this way, and you quite well know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, to be sure,&rdquo; I answered gravely, and had the satisfaction of
      noting that he looked quite a little foolish. Too well he knew I could not
      be deceived, and even now I could surmise that the lobster had been
      supported by sherry. How many times have I not explained to him that
      sherry has double the tonic vinosity of any other wine and may not be
      tampered with by the sensitive. But he chose at present to make light of
      it, almost as if he were chaffing above his knowledge of some calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some book Johnny says a chap is either a fool or a physician at forty,&rdquo;
       he remarked, drawing the blanket more closely about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hardly rank you as a Harley Street consultant, sir,&rdquo; I swiftly
      retorted, which was slanging him enormously because he had turned forty. I
      mean to say, there was but one thing he could take me as meaning him to
      be, since at forty I considered him no physician. But at least I had not
      been too blunt, the touch about the Harley Street consultant being rather
      neat, I thought, yet not too subtle for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now demanded a pipe of tobacco, and for a time smoked in silence. I
      could see that his mind worked painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stiffish lot, those Americans,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do so many things one doesn&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And their brogue is not what one could call top-hole, is it now? How
      often they say &lsquo;I guess!&rsquo; I fancy they must say it a score of times in a
      half-hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy they do, sir,&rdquo; I agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy that Johnny with the eyebrows will say it even oftener.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy so, sir. I fancy I&rsquo;ve counted it well up to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy you&rsquo;re quite right. And the chap &lsquo;guesses&rsquo; when he awfully well
      knows, too. That&rsquo;s the essential rabbit. To-night he said &lsquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve
      got you beaten to a pulp,&rsquo; when I fancy he wasn&rsquo;t guessing at all. I mean
      to say, I swear he knew it perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lost the game of drawing poker?&rdquo; I asked coldly, though I knew he had
      carried little to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lost&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began. I observed he was strangely embarrassed.
      He strangled over his pipe and began anew: &ldquo;I said that to play the game
      soundly you&rsquo;ve only to know when to bluff. Studied it out myself, and
      jolly well right I was, too, as far as I went. But there&rsquo;s further to go
      in the silly game. I hadn&rsquo;t observed that to play it greatly one must also
      know when one&rsquo;s opponent is bluffing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, really; quite important, I assure you. More important than one would
      have believed, watching their silly ways. You fancy a chap&rsquo;s bluffing when
      he&rsquo;s doing nothing of the sort. I&rsquo;d enormously have liked to know it
      before we played. Things would have been so awfully different for us&rdquo;&mdash;he
      broke off curiously, paused, then added&mdash;&ldquo;for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Different for me, sir?&rdquo; His words seemed gruesome. They seemed open to
      some vaguely sinister interpretation. But I kept myself steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We live and learn, sir,&rdquo; I said, lightly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of us learn too late,&rdquo; he replied, increasingly ominous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it you failed to win the hundred pounds, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration: &ldquo;I TAKE IT YOU FAILED TO WIN THE HUNDRED POUNDS, SIR?&rdquo;}
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the hundred pounds; I won it&mdash;by losing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he evaded my eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Played, indeed, sir,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You jolly well won&rsquo;t believe that for long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now as he had the hundred pounds, I couldn&rsquo;t fancy what the deuce and all
      he meant by such prattle. I was half afraid he might be having me on, as I
      have known him do now and again when he fancied he could get me. I
      fearfully wanted to ask questions. Again I saw the dark, absorbed face of
      the gipsy as he studied my future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rotten shift, life is,&rdquo; now murmured the Honourable George quite as if he
      had forgotten me. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d have but put through that Monte Carlo affair I
      dare say I&rsquo;d have chucked the whole business&mdash;gone to South Africa,
      perhaps, and set up a mine or a plantation. Shouldn&rsquo;t have come back. Just
      cut off, and good-bye to this mess. But no capital. Can&rsquo;t do things
      without capital. Where these American Johnnies have the pull of us. Do
      anything. Nearly do what they jolly well like to. No sense to money. Stuff
      that runs blind. Look at the silly beggars that have it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; On
      he went quite alarmingly with his tirade. Almost as violent he was as an
      ugly-headed chap I once heard ranting when I went with my brother-in-law
      to a meeting of the North Brixton Radical Club. Quite like an anarchist he
      was. Presently he quieted. After a long pull at his pipe he regarded me
      with an entire change of manner. Well I knew something was coming; coming
      swift as a rocketing woodcock. Word for word I put down our incredible
      speeches:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going out to America, Ruggles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; North or South, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;North, I fancy; somewhere on the West coast&mdash;Ohio, Omaha, one of
      those Indian places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Indiana or the Yellowstone Valley, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chap&rsquo;s a sort of millionaire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chap, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eyebrow chap. Money no end&mdash;mines, lumber, domestic animals, that
      sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, sir! I&rsquo;m to go&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chap&rsquo;s wife taken a great fancy to you. Would have you to do for the
      funny, sad beggar. So he&rsquo;s won you. Won you in a game of drawing poker.
      Another man would have done as well, but the creature was keen for you.
      Great strength of character. Determined sort. Hope you won&rsquo;t think I
      didn&rsquo;t play soundly, but it&rsquo;s not a forthright game. Think they&rsquo;re
      bluffing when they aren&rsquo;t. When they are you mayn&rsquo;t think it. So far as
      hiding one&rsquo;s intentions, it&rsquo;s a most rottenly immoral game. Low, animal
      cunning&mdash;that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I understand I was the stake, sir?&rdquo; I controlled myself to say. The
      heavens seemed bursting about my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ultimately lost you were by the very trifling margin of superiority that
      a hand known as a club flush bears over another hand consisting of three
      of the eights&mdash;not quite all of them, you understand, only three, and
      two other quite meaningless cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could but stammer piteously, I fear. I heard myself make a wretched
      failure of words that crowded to my lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s quite simple, I tell you. I dare say I could show it you in a
      moment if you&rsquo;ve cards in your box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir, I&rsquo;ll not trouble you. I&rsquo;m certain it was simple. But
      would you mind telling me what exactly the game was played for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knew you&rsquo;d not understand at once. My word, it was not too bally simple.
      If I won I&rsquo;d a hundred pounds. If I lost I&rsquo;d to give you up to them but
      still to receive a hundred pounds. I suspect the Johnny&rsquo;s conscience
      pricked him. Thought you were worth a hundred pounds, and guessed all the
      time he could do me awfully in the eye with his poker. Quite set they were
      on having you. Eyebrow chap seemed to think it a jolly good wheeze. She
      didn&rsquo;t, though. Quite off her head at having you for that glum one who
      does himself so badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dazed I was, to be sure, scarce comprehending the calamity that had
      befallen us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand, sir, that I am now in the service of the Americans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stupid! Of course, of course! Explained clearly, haven&rsquo;t I, about the
      club flush and the three eights. Only three of them, mind you. If the
      other one had been in my hand, I&rsquo;d have done him. As narrow a squeak as
      that. But I lost. And you may be certain I lost gamely, as a gentleman
      should. No laughing matter, but I laughed with them&mdash;except the
      funny, sad one. He was worried and made no secret of it. They were good
      enough to say I took my loss like a dead sport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More of it followed, but always the same. Ever he came back to the
      sickening, concise point that I was to go out to the American wilderness
      with these grotesque folk who had but the most elementary notions of what
      one does and what one does not do. Always he concluded with his boast that
      he had taken his loss like a dead sport. He became vexed at last by my
      painful efforts to understand how, precisely, the dreadful thing had come
      about. But neither could I endure more. I fled to my room. He had tried
      again to impress upon me that three eights are but slightly inferior to
      the flush of clubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I faced my glass. My ordinary smooth, full face seemed to have shrivelled.
      The marks of my anguish were upon me. Vainly had I locked myself in. The
      gipsy&rsquo;s warning had borne its evil fruit. Sold, I&rsquo;d been; even as once the
      poor blackamoors were sold into American bondage. I recalled one of their
      pathetic folk-songs in which the wretches were wont to make light of their
      lamentable estate; a thing I had often heard sung by a black with a banjo
      on the pier at Brighton; not a genuine black, only dyed for the moment he
      was, but I had never lost the plaintive quality of the verses:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Away down South in Michigan,
    Where I was so happy and so gay,
    &lsquo;Twas there I mowed the cotton and the cane&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      How poignantly the simple words came back to me! A slave, day after day
      mowing his owner&rsquo;s cotton and cane, plucking the maize from the savannahs,
      yet happy and gay! Should I be equal to this spirit? The Honourable George
      had lost; so I, his pawn, must also submit like a dead sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      How little I then dreamed what adventures, what adversities, what
      ignominies&mdash;yes, and what triumphs were to be mine in those back
      blocks of North America! I saw but a bleak wilderness, a distressing
      contact with people who never for a moment would do with us. I shuddered.
      I despaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      And outside the windows gay Paris laughed and sang in the dance, ever
      unheeding my plight!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWO
    </h2>
    <p>
      In that first sleep how often do we dream that our calamity has been only
      a dream. It was so in my first moments of awakening. Vestiges of some
      grotesquely hideous nightmare remained with me. Wearing the shackles of
      the slave, I had been mowing the corn under the fierce sun that beats down
      upon the American savannahs. Sickeningly, then, a wind of memory blew upon
      me and I was alive to my situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was I forgetful of the plight in which the Honourable George would now
      find himself. He is as good as lost when not properly looked after. In the
      ordinary affairs of life he is a simple, trusting, incompetent duffer, if
      ever there was one. Even in so rudimentary a matter as collar-studs he is
      like a storm-tossed mariner&mdash;I mean to say, like a chap in a boat on
      the ocean who doesn&rsquo;t know what sails to pull up nor how to steer the
      silly rudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      One rather feels exactly that about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he was bound to go seedy beyond description&mdash;like the time at
      Mentone when he dreamed a system for playing the little horses, after
      which for a fortnight I was obliged to nurse a well-connected invalid in
      order that we might last over till next remittance day. The havoc he
      managed to wreak among his belongings in that time would scarce be
      believed should I set it down&mdash;not even a single boot properly treed&mdash;and
      his appearance when I was enabled to recover him (my client having behaved
      most handsomely on the eve of his departure for Spain) being such that I
      passed him in the hotel lounge without even a nod&mdash;climbing-boots,
      with trousers from his one suit of boating flannels, a blazered golfing
      waistcoat, his best morning-coat with the wide braid, a hunting-stock and
      a motoring-cap, with his beard more than discursive, as one might say,
      than I had ever seen it. If I disclose this thing it is only that my fears
      for him may be comprehended when I pictured him being permanently out of
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meditating thus bitterly, I had but finished dressing when I was startled
      by a knock on my door and by the entrance, to my summons, of the elder and
      more subdued Floud, he of the drooping mustaches and the mournful eyes of
      pale blue. One glance at his attire brought freshly to my mind the
      atrocious difficulties of my new situation. I may be credited or not, but
      combined with tan boots and wretchedly fitting trousers of a purple hue he
      wore a black frock-coat, revealing far, far too much of a blue satin
      &ldquo;made&rdquo; cravat on which was painted a cluster of tiny white flowers&mdash;lilies
      of the valley, I should say. Unbelievably above this monstrous mélange was
      a rather low-crowned bowler hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly repressing a shudder, I bowed, whereupon he advanced solemnly to me
      and put out his hand. To cover the embarrassing situation tactfully I
      extended my own, and we actually shook hands, although the clasp was
      limply quite formal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Ruggles?&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed again, but speech failed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sent me over to get you,&rdquo; he went on. He uttered the word &ldquo;She&rdquo; with
      such profound awe that I knew he could mean none other than Mrs. Effie. It
      was most extraordinary, but I dare say only what was to have been expected
      from persons of this sort. In any good-class club or among gentlemen at
      large it is customary to allow one at least twenty-four hours for the
      payment of one&rsquo;s gambling debts. Yet there I was being collected by the
      winner at so early an hour as half-after seven. If I had been a five-pound
      note instead of myself, I fancy it would have been quite the same. These
      Americans would most indecently have sent for their winnings before the
      Honourable George had awakened. One would have thought they had expected
      him to refuse payment of me after losing me the night before. How little
      they seemed to realize that we were both intending to be dead sportsmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I trust I may be allowed to brew the
      Honourable George his tea before leaving? I&rsquo;d hardly like to trust to him
      alone with it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he said, so respectfully that it gave me an odd feeling. &ldquo;Take
      your time, Mr. Ruggles. I don&rsquo;t know as I am in any hurry on my own
      account. It&rsquo;s only account of Her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I trust it will be remembered that in reporting this person&rsquo;s speeches I
      am making an earnest effort to set them down word for word in all their
      terrific peculiarities. I mean to say, I would not be held accountable for
      his phrasing, and if I corrected his speech, as of course the tendency is,
      our identities might become confused. I hope this will be understood when
      I report him as saying things in ways one doesn&rsquo;t word them. I mean to say
      that it should not be thought that I would say them in this way if it
      chanced that I were saying the same things in my proper person. I fancy
      this should now be plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was me,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want you a little bit. But it&rsquo;s
      Her. She&rsquo;s got her mind made up to do the right thing and have us all be
      somebody, and when she makes her mind up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated and
      studied the ceiling for some seconds. &ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;Mrs.
      Effie is some wildcat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;some wildcat,&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe <i>me</i>, Bill,&rdquo; he said again, quaintly addressing me by a name
      not my own&mdash;&ldquo;believe me, she&rsquo;d fight a rattlesnake and give it the
      first two bites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again let it be recalled that I put down this extraordinary speech exactly
      as I heard it. I thought to detect in it that grotesque exaggeration with
      which the Americans so distressingly embellish their humour. I mean to
      say, it could hardly have been meant in all seriousness. So far as my
      researches have extended, the rattlesnake is an invariably poisonous
      reptile. Fancy giving one so downright an advantage as the first two
      bites, or even one bite, although I believe the thing does not in fact
      bite at all, but does one down with its forked tongue, of which there is
      an excellent drawing in my little volume, &ldquo;Inquire Within; 1,000 Useful
      Facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; I replied, somewhat at a loss; &ldquo;quite so, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just thought I&rsquo;d wise you up beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; I said, for his intention beneath the weird jargon was
      somehow benevolent. &ldquo;And if you&rsquo;ll be good enough to wait until I have
      taken tea to the Honourable George&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the Judge this morning?&rdquo; he broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Judge, sir?&rdquo; I was at a loss, until he gestured toward the room of
      the Honourable George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Judge, yes. Ain&rsquo;t he a justice of the peace or something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no, sir; not at all, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what do you call him &lsquo;Honourable&rsquo; for, if he ain&rsquo;t a judge or
      something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, it&rsquo;s done, sir,&rdquo; I explained, but I fear he was unable to
      catch my meaning, for a moment later (the Honourable George, hearing our
      voices, had thrown a boot smartly against the door) he was addressing him
      as &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; and thereafter continued to do so, nor did the Honourable
      George seem to make any moment of being thus miscalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      I served the Ceylon tea, together with biscuits and marmalade, the while
      our caller chatted nervously. He had, it appeared, procured his own
      breakfast while on his way to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got to have my ham and eggs of a morning,&rdquo; he confided. &ldquo;But she won&rsquo;t
      let me have anything at that hotel but a continental breakfast, which is
      nothing but coffee and toast and some of that there sauce you&rsquo;re eating.
      She says when I&rsquo;m on the continent I got to eat a continental breakfast,
      because that&rsquo;s the smart thing to do, and not stuff myself like I was on
      the ranch; but I got that game beat both ways from the jack. I duck out
      every morning before she&rsquo;s up. I found a place where you can get regular
      ham and eggs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regular ham and eggs?&rdquo; murmured the Honourable George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;French ham and eggs is a joke. They put a slice of boiled ham in a little
      dish, slosh a couple of eggs on it, and tuck the dish into the oven a few
      minutes. Say, they won&rsquo;t ever believe that back in Red Gap when I tell it.
      But I found this here little place where they do it right, account of
      Americans having made trouble so much over the other way. But, mind you,
      don&rsquo;t let on to her,&rdquo; he warned me suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, sir,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Trust me to be discreet, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then. Maybe we&rsquo;ll get on better than what I thought we would.
      I was looking for trouble with you, the way she&rsquo;s been talking about what
      you&rsquo;d do for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust matters will be pleasant, sir,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can be pushed just so far,&rdquo; he curiously warned me, &ldquo;and no farther&mdash;not
      by any man that wears hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; I said again, wondering what the wearing of hair might mean to
      this process of pushing him, and feeling rather absurdly glad that my own
      face is smoothly shaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find Ruggles fairish enough after you&rsquo;ve got used to his ways,&rdquo;
       put in the Honourable George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Judge; and remember it wasn&rsquo;t my doings,&rdquo; said my new
      employer, rising and pulling down to his ears his fearful bowler hat. &ldquo;And
      now we better report to her before she does a hot-foot over here. You can
      pack your grip later in the day,&rdquo; he added to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pack my grip&mdash;yes, sir,&rdquo; I said numbly, for I was on the tick of
      leaving the Honourable George helpless in bed. In a voice that I fear was
      broken I spoke of clothes for the day&rsquo;s wear which I had laid out for him
      the night before. He waved a hand bravely at us and sank back into his
      pillow as my new employer led me forth. There had been barely a glance
      between us to betoken the dreadfulness of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At our door I was pleased to note that a taximetre cab awaited us. I had
      acutely dreaded a walk through the streets, even of Paris, with my new
      employer garbed as he was. The blue satin cravat of itself would have been
      bound to insure us more attention than one would care for.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fear we were both somewhat moody during the short ride. Each of us
      seemed to have matters of weight to reflect upon. Only upon reaching our
      destination did my companion brighten a bit. For a fare of five francs
      forty centimes he gave the driver a ten-franc piece and waited for no
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always get around them that way,&rdquo; he said with an expression of the
      brightest cunning. &ldquo;She used to have the laugh on me because I got so much
      counterfeit money handed to me. Now I don&rsquo;t take any change at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Quite right, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than one way to skin a cat,&rdquo; he added as we ascended to the
      Floud&rsquo;s drawing-room, though why his mind should have flown to this brutal
      sport, if it be a sport, was quite beyond me. At the door he paused and
      hissed at me: &ldquo;Remember, no matter what she says, if you treat me white
      I&rsquo;ll treat you white.&rdquo; And before I could frame any suitable response to
      this puzzling announcement he had opened the door and pushed me in, almost
      before I could remove my cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated at the table over coffee and rolls was Mrs. Effie. Her face
      brightened as she saw me, then froze to disapproval as her glance rested
      upon him I was to know as Cousin Egbert. I saw her capable mouth set in a
      straight line of determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did your very worst, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;But sit down and eat
      your breakfast. He&rsquo;ll soon change <i>that</i>.&rdquo; She turned to me. &ldquo;Now,
      Ruggles, I hope you understand the situation, and I&rsquo;m sure I can trust you
      to take no nonsense from him. You see plainly what you&rsquo;ve got to do. I let
      him dress to suit himself this morning, so that you could know the worst
      at once. Take a good look at him&mdash;shoes, coat, hat&mdash;that
      dreadful cravat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call this a right pretty necktie,&rdquo; mumbled her victim over a crust of
      toast. She had poured coffee for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear that?&rdquo; she asked me. I bowed sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he look like?&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Just tell him for his own good,
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this I could not do. True enough, during our short ride he had been
      reminding me of one of a pair of cross-talk comedians I had once seen in a
      music-hall. This, of course, was not a thing one could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say, Madam, he could be smartened up a bit. If I might take him to
      some good-class shop&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And burn the things he&rsquo;s got on&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this here necktie,&rdquo; interrupted Cousin Egbert rather stubbornly. &ldquo;It
      was give to me by Jeff Tuttle&rsquo;s littlest girl last Christmas; and this
      here Prince Albert coat&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter of it, I&rsquo;d like to know?
      It come right from the One Price Clothing Store at Red Gap, and it&rsquo;s
      plenty good to go to funerals in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then to a barber-shop with him,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Effie, who had paid no
      heed to his outburst. &ldquo;Get him done right for once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her relative continued to nibble nervously at a bit of toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done something with him myself,&rdquo; she said, watching him narrowly.
      &ldquo;At first he insisted on having the whole bill-of-fare for breakfast, but
      I put my foot down, and now he&rsquo;s satisfied with the continental breakfast.
      That goes to show he has something in him, if we can only bring it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something in him, indeed, yes, Madam!&rdquo; I assented, and Cousin Egbert,
      turning to me, winked heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want him to look like some one,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;and I think you&rsquo;re the
      man can make him if you&rsquo;re firm with him; but you&rsquo;ll have to be firm,
      because he&rsquo;s full of tricks. And if he starts any rough stuff, just come
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, Madam,&rdquo; I said, but I felt I was blushing with shame at hearing
      one of my own sex so slanged by a woman. That sort of thing would never do
      with us. And yet there was something about this woman&mdash;something
      weirdly authoritative. She showed rather well in the morning light, her
      gray eyes crackling as she talked. She was wearing a most elaborate
      peignoir, and of course she should not have worn the diamonds; it seemed
      almost too much like the morning hour of a stage favourite; but still one
      felt that when she talked one would do well to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon Cousin Egbert startled me once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you set up and have something with us, Mr. Ruggles?&rdquo; he asked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked away, affecting not to have heard, and could feel Mrs. Effie
      scowling at him. He coughed into his cup and sprayed coffee well over
      himself. His intention had been obvious in the main, though exactly what
      he had meant by &ldquo;setting up&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t fancy&mdash;as if I had been a
      performing poodle!
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment&rsquo;s embarrassment was well covered by Mrs. Effie, who again
      renewed her instructions, and from an escritoire brought me a sheaf of the
      pretentiously printed sheets which the French use in place of our
      banknotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will spare no expense,&rdquo; she directed, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t let me see him again
      until he looks like some one. Try to have him back here by five. Some very
      smart friends of ours are coming for tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t drink tea at that outlandish hour for any one,&rdquo; said Cousin
      Egbert rather snappishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will at least refuse it like a man of the world, I hope,&rdquo; she replied
      icily, and he drooped submissive once more. &ldquo;You see?&rdquo; she added to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, Madam,&rdquo; I said, and resolved to be firm and thorough with
      Cousin Egbert. In a way I was put upon my mettle. I swore to make him look
      like some one. Moreover, I now saw that his half-veiled threats of
      rebellion to me had been pure swank. I had in turn but to threaten to
      report him to this woman and he would be as clay in my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      I presently had him tucked into a closed taxicab, half-heartedly muttering
      expostulations and protests to which I paid not the least heed. During my
      strolls I had observed in what would have been Regent Street at home a
      rather good-class shop with an English name, and to this I now proceeded
      with my charge. I am afraid I rather hustled him across the pavement and
      into the shop, not knowing what tricks he might be up to, and not until he
      was well to the back did I attempt to explain myself to the shop-walker
      who had followed us. To him I then gave details of my charge&rsquo;s escape from
      a burning hotel the previous night, which accounted for his extraordinary
      garb of the moment, he having been obliged to accept the loan of garments
      that neither fitted him nor harmonized with one another. I mean to say, I
      did not care to have the chap suspect we would don tan boots, a
      frock-coat, and bowler hat except under the most tremendous compulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert stared at me open mouthed during this recital, but the
      shop-walker was only too readily convinced, as indeed who would not have
      been, and called an intelligent assistant to relieve our distress. With
      his help I swiftly selected an outfit that was not half bad for
      ready-to-wear garments. There was a black morning-coat, snug at the waist,
      moderately broad at the shoulders, closing with two buttons, its skirt
      sharply cut away from the lower button and reaching to the bend of the
      knee. The lapels were, of course, soft-rolled and joined the collar with a
      triangular notch. It is a coat of immense character when properly worn,
      and I was delighted to observe in the trying on that Cousin Egbert filled
      it rather smartly. Moreover, he submitted more meekly than I had hoped.
      The trousers I selected were of gray cloth, faintly striped, the waistcoat
      being of the same material as the coat, relieved at the neck-opening by an
      edging of white.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the boots I had rather more trouble, as he refused to wear the patent
      leathers that I selected, together with the pearl gray spats, until I
      grimly requested the telephone assistant to put me through to the hotel,
      desiring to speak to Mrs. Senator Floud. This brought him around, although
      muttering, and I had less trouble with shirts, collars, and cravats. I
      chose a shirt of white piqué, a wing collar with small, square-cornered
      tabs, and a pearl ascot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in a cabinet I superintended Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s change of raiment. We
      clashed again in the matter of sock-suspenders, which I was astounded to
      observe he did not possess. He insisted that he had never worn them&mdash;garters
      he called them&mdash;and never would if he were shot for it, so I decided
      to be content with what I had already gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      By dint of urging and threatening I at length achieved my ground-work and
      was more than a little pleased with my effect, as was the shop-assistant,
      after I had tied the pearl ascot and adjusted a quiet tie-pin of my own
      choosing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I hope you&rsquo;re satisfied!&rdquo; growled my charge, seizing his bowler hat
      and edging off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; I said coldly. &ldquo;The hat, if you please, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave it up rebelliously, and I had again to threaten him with the
      telephone before he would submit to a top-hat with a moderate bell and
      broad brim. Surveying this in the glass, however, he became perceptibly
      reconciled. It was plain that he rather fancied it, though as yet he wore
      it consciously and would turn his head slowly and painfully, as if his
      neck were stiffened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having chosen the proper gloves, I was, I repeat, more than pleased with
      this severely simple scheme of black, white, and gray. I felt I had been
      wise to resist any tendency to colour, even to the most delicate of pastel
      tints. My last selection was a smartish Malacca stick, the ideal stick for
      town wear, which I thrust into the defenceless hands of my client.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, sir,&rdquo; I said firmly, &ldquo;it is but a step to a barber&rsquo;s stop where
      English is spoken.&rdquo; And ruefully he accompanied me. I dare say that by
      that time he had discovered that I was not to be trifled with, for during
      his hour in the barber&rsquo;s chair he did not once rebel openly. Only at times
      would he roll his eyes to mine in dumb appeal. There was in them something
      of the utter confiding helplessness I had noted in the eyes of an old
      setter at Chaynes-Wotten when I had been called upon to assist the
      undergardener in chloroforming him. I mean to say, the dog had jolly well
      known something terrible was being done to him, yet his eyes seemed to say
      he knew it must be all for the best and that he trusted us. It was this
      look I caught as I gave directions about the trimming of the hair, and
      especially when I directed that something radical should be done to the
      long, grayish moustache that fell to either side of his chin in the form
      of a horseshoe. I myself was puzzled by this difficulty, but the barber
      solved it rather neatly, I thought, after a whispered consultation with
      me. He snipped a bit off each end and then stoutly waxed the whole affair
      until the ends stood stiffly out with distinct military implications. I
      shall never forget, and indeed I was not a little touched by the look of
      quivering anguish in the eyes of my client when he first beheld this novel
      effect. And yet when we were once more in the street I could not but admit
      that the change was worth all that it had cost him in suffering.
      Strangely, he now looked like some one, especially after I had persuaded
      him to a carnation for his buttonhole. I cannot say that his carriage was
      all that it should have been, and he was still conscious of his smart
      attire, but I nevertheless felt a distinct thrill of pride in my own work,
      and was eager to reveal him to Mrs. Effie in his new guise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But first he would have luncheon&mdash;dinner he called it&mdash;and I was
      not averse to this, for I had put in a long and trying morning. I went
      with him to the little restaurant where Americans had made so much trouble
      about ham and eggs, and there he insisted that I should join him in chops
      and potatoes and ale. I thought it only proper then to point out to him
      that there was certain differences in our walks of life which should be
      more or less denoted by his manner of addressing me. Among other things he
      should not address me as Mr. Ruggles, nor was it customary for a valet to
      eat at the same table with his master. He seemed much interested in these
      distinctions and thereupon addressed me as &ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; which was of course
      quite absurd, but this I could not make him see. Thereafter, I may say,
      that he called me impartially either &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bill.&rdquo; It was a
      situation that I had never before been obliged to meet, and I found it
      trying in the extreme. He was a chap who seemed ready to pal up with any
      one, and I could not but recall the strange assertion I had so often heard
      that in America one never knows who is one&rsquo;s superior. Fancy that! It
      would never do with us. I could only determine to be on my guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our luncheon done, he consented to accompany me to the hotel of the
      Honourable George, whence I wished to remove my belongings. I should have
      preferred to go alone, but I was too fearful of what he might do to
      himself or his clothes in my absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found the Honourable George still in bed, as I had feared. He had, it
      seemed, been unable to discover his collar studs, which, though I had
      placed them in a fresh shirt for him, he had carelessly covered with a
      blanket. Begging Cousin Egbert to be seated in my room, I did a few of the
      more obvious things required by my late master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d leave me here like a rat in a trap,&rdquo; he said reproachfully, which I
      thought almost quite a little unjust. I mean to say, it had all been his
      own doing, he having lost me in the game of drawing poker, so why should
      he row me about it now? I silently laid out the shirt once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have told me where I&rsquo;m to find my brown tweeds and the body
      linen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he was addressing me as if I had voluntarily left him without
      notice, but I observed that he was still mildly speckled from the night
      before, so I handed him the fruit-lozenges, and went to pack my own box.
      Cousin Egbert I found sitting as I had left him, on the edge of a chair,
      carefully holding his hat, stick, and gloves, and staring into the wall.
      He had promised me faithfully not to fumble with his cravat, and evidently
      he had not once stirred. I packed my box swiftly&mdash;my &ldquo;grip,&rdquo; as he
      called it&mdash;and we were presently off once more, without another sight
      of the Honourable George, who was to join us at tea. I could hear him
      moving about, using rather ultra-frightful language, but I lacked heart
      for further speech with him at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, in the Floud drawing-room, I had the supreme satisfaction
      of displaying to Mrs. Effie the happy changes I had been able to effect in
      my charge. Posing him, I knocked at the door of her chamber. She came at
      once and drew a long breath as she surveyed him, from varnished boots,
      spats, and coat to top-hat, which he still wore. He leaned rather well on
      his stick, the hand to his hip, the elbow out, while the other hand
      lightly held his gloves. A moment she looked, then gave a low cry of
      wonder and delight, so that I felt repaid for my trouble. Indeed, as she
      faced me to thank me I could see that her eyes were dimmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Now he looks like some one!&rdquo; And I distinctly
      perceived that only just in time did she repress an impulse to grasp me by
      the hand. Under the circumstances I am not sure that I wouldn&rsquo;t have
      overlooked the lapse had she yielded to it. &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; she said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration: &ldquo;WONDERFUL! NOW HE LOOKS LIKE SOME ONE&rdquo;}
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon Cousin Egbert, much embarrassed, leaned his stick against the
      wall; the stick fell, and in reaching down for it his hat fell, and in
      reaching for that he dropped his gloves; but I soon restored him to order
      and he was safely seated where he might be studied in further detail,
      especially as to his moustaches, which I had considered rather the supreme
      touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks exactly like some well-known clubman,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her relative growled as if he were quite ready to savage her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a man about town,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Who would have thought he had it
      in him until you brought it out?&rdquo; I knew then that we two should
      understand each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slight tension was here relieved by two of the hotel servants who
      brought tea things. At a nod from Mrs. Effie I directed the laying out of
      these.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment came the other Floud, he of the eyebrows, and a cousin cub
      called Elmer, who, I understood, studied art. I became aware that they
      were both suddenly engaged and silenced by the sight of Cousin Egbert. I
      caught their amazed stares, and then terrifically they broke into gales of
      laughter. The cub threw himself on a couch, waving his feet in the air,
      and holding his middle as if he&rsquo;d suffered a sudden acute dyspepsia, while
      the elder threw his head back and shrieked hysterically. Cousin Egbert
      merely glared at them and, endeavouring to stroke his moustache, succeeded
      in unwaxing one side of it so that it once more hung limply down his chin,
      whereat they renewed their boorishness. The elder Floud was now quite
      dangerously purple, and the cub on the couch was shrieking: &ldquo;No matter how
      dark the clouds, remember she is still your stepmother,&rdquo; or words to some
      such silly effect as that. How it might have ended I hardly dare
      conjecture&mdash;perhaps Cousin Egbert would presently have roughed them&mdash;but
      a knock sounded, and it became my duty to open our door upon other guests,
      women mostly; Americans in Paris; that sort of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I served the tea amid their babble. The Honourable George was shown up a
      bit later, having done to himself quite all I thought he might in the
      matter of dress. In spite of serious discrepancies in his attire, however,
      I saw that Mrs. Effie meant to lionize him tremendously. With vast
      ceremony he was presented to her guests&mdash;the Honourable George
      Augustus Vane-Basingwell, brother of his lordship the Earl of Brinstead.
      The women fluttered about him rather, though he behaved moodily, and at
      the first opportunity fell to the tea and cakes quite wholeheartedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of my aversion to the American wilderness, I felt a bit of
      professional pride in reflecting that my first day in this new service was
      about to end so auspiciously. Yet even in that moment, being as yet
      unfamiliar with the room&rsquo;s lesser furniture, I stumbled slightly against a
      hassock hid from me by the tray I carried. A cup of tea was lost, though
      my recovery was quick. Too late I observed that the hitherto self-effacing
      Cousin Egbert was in range of my clumsiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes tea all over my new pants!&rdquo; he said in a high, pained voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, indeed, sir,&rdquo; said I, a ready napkin in hand. &ldquo;Let me dry it,
      sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I fancy quite so, sir,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      I most truly would have liked to shake him smartly for this. I saw that my
      work was cut out for me among these Americans, from whom at their best one
      expects so little.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THREE
    </h2>
    <p>
      As I brisked out of bed the following morning at half-after six, I could
      not but wonder rather nervously what the day might have in store for me. I
      was obliged to admit that what I was in for looked a bit thick. As I
      opened my door I heard stealthy footsteps down the hall and looked out in
      time to observe Cousin Egbert entering his own room. It was not this that
      startled me. He would have been abroad, I knew, for the ham and eggs that
      were forbidden him. Yet I stood aghast, for with the lounge-suit of tweeds
      I had selected the day before he had worn his top-hat! I am aware that
      these things I relate of him may not be credited. I can only put them down
      in all sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hastened to him and removed the thing from his head. I fear it was not
      with the utmost deference, for I have my human moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not done, sir,&rdquo; I protested. He saw that I was offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; he replied meekly. &ldquo;But how was I to know? I thought it
      kind of set me off.&rdquo; He referred to it as a &ldquo;stove-pipe&rdquo; hat. I knew then
      that I should find myself overlooking many things in him. He was not a
      person one could be stern with, and I even promised that Mrs. Effie should
      not be told of his offence, he promising in turn never again to stir
      abroad without first submitting himself to me and agreeing also to wear
      sock-suspenders from that day forth. I saw, indeed, that diplomacy might
      work wonders with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast in the drawing-room, during which Cousin Egbert earned warm
      praise from Mrs. Effie for his lack of appetite (he winking violently at
      me during this), I learned that I should be expected to accompany him to a
      certain art gallery which corresponds to our British Museum. I was a bit
      surprised, indeed, to learn that he largely spent his days there, and was
      accustomed to make notes of the various objects of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insisted,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Effie, &ldquo;that he should absorb all the culture
      he could on his trip abroad, so I got him a notebook in which he puts down
      his impressions, and I must say he&rsquo;s done fine. Some of his remarks are so
      good that when he gets home I may have him read a paper before our Onwards
      and Upwards Club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert wriggled modestly at this and said: &ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; which I took
      to be a term of deprecation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t pretend,&rdquo; said Mrs. Effie. &ldquo;Just let Ruggles here look over
      some of the notes you have made,&rdquo; and she handed me a notebook of ruled
      paper in which there was a deal of writing. I glanced, as bidden, at one
      or two of the paragraphs, and confess that I, too, was amazed at the
      fluency and insight displayed along lines in which I should have thought
      the man entirely uninformed. &ldquo;This choice work represents the first or
      formative period of the Master,&rdquo; began one note, &ldquo;but distinctly
      foreshadows that later method which made him at once the hope and despair
      of his contemporaries. In the &lsquo;Portrait of the Artist by Himself&rsquo; we have
      a canvas that well repays patient study, since here is displayed in its
      full flower that ruthless realism, happily attenuated by a superbly subtle
      delicacy of brush work&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; It was really quite amazing, and I
      perceived for the first time that Cousin Egbert must be &ldquo;a diamond in the
      rough,&rdquo; as the well-known saying has it. I felt, indeed, that I would be
      very pleased to accompany him on one of his instructive strolls through
      this gallery, for I have always been of a studious habit and anxious to
      improve myself in the fine arts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Effie, when I had perused this fragment. &ldquo;And yet
      folks back home would tell you that he&rsquo;s just a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Cousin
      Egbert here coughed alarmingly. &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll show
      them that he&rsquo;s got something in him, mark my words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, Madam,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I shall consider it a privilege to be
      present when he further prosecutes his art studies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may keep him out till dinner-time,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shopping this
      morning, and in the afternoon I shall motor to have tea in the Boy with
      the Senator and Mr. Nevil Vane-Basingwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently, then, my charge and I set out for what I hoped was to be a
      peaceful and instructive day among objects of art, though first I was
      obliged to escort him to a hatter&rsquo;s and glover&rsquo;s to remedy some minor
      discrepancies in his attire. He was very pleased when I permitted him to
      select his own hat. I was safe in this, as the shop was really artists in
      gentlemen&rsquo;s headwear, and carried only shapes, I observed, that were
      confined to exclusive firms so as to insure their being worn by the right
      set. As to gloves and a stick, he was again rather pettish and had to be
      set right with some firmness. He declared he had lost his stick and gloves
      of the previous day. I discovered later that he had presented them to the
      lift attendant. But I soon convinced him that he would not be let to
      appear without these adjuncts to a gentleman&rsquo;s toilet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, having once more stood by at the barber&rsquo;s while he was shaved and
      his moustaches firmly waxed anew, I saw that he was fit at last for his
      art studies. The barber this day suggested curling the moustaches with a
      heated iron, but at this my charge fell into so unseemly a rage that I
      deemed it wise not to insist. He, indeed, bluntly threatened a nameless
      violence to the barber if he were so much as touched with the iron, and
      revealed an altogether shocking gift for profanity, saying loudly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      be&mdash;dashed&mdash;if you will!&rdquo; I mean to say, I have written &ldquo;dashed&rdquo;
       for what he actually said. But at length I had him once more quieted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; I said, when I had got him from the barber&rsquo;s shop, to the
      barber&rsquo;s manifest relief: &ldquo;I fancy we&rsquo;ve time to do a few objects of art
      before luncheon. I&rsquo;ve the book here for your comments,&rdquo; I added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; he replied, and led me at a rapid pace along the street in
      what I presumed was the direction of the art museum. At the end of a few
      blocks he paused at one of those open-air public houses that disgracefully
      line the streets of the French capital. I mean to say that chairs and
      tables are set out upon the pavement in the most brazen manner and
      occupied by the populace, who there drink their silly beverages and idle
      away their time. After scanning the score or so of persons present, even
      at so early an hour as ten of the morning, he fell into one of the iron
      chairs at one of the iron tables and motioned me to another at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had seated myself he said &ldquo;Beer&rdquo; to the waiter who appeared, and
      held up two fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look at here,&rdquo; he resumed to me, &ldquo;this is a good place to do about
      four pages of art, and then we can go out and have some recreation
      somewhere.&rdquo; Seeing that I was puzzled, he added: &ldquo;This way&mdash;you take
      that notebook and write in it out of this here other book till I think
      you&rsquo;ve done enough, then I&rsquo;ll tell you to stop.&rdquo; And while I was still
      bewildered, he drew from an inner pocket a small, well-thumbed volume
      which I took from him and saw to be entitled &ldquo;One Hundred Masterpieces of
      the Louvre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open her about the middle,&rdquo; he directed, &ldquo;and pick out something that
      begins good, like &lsquo;Here the true art-lover will stand entranced&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
      You got to write it, because I guess you can write faster than what I can.
      I&rsquo;ll tell her I dictated to you. Get a hustle on now, so&rsquo;s we can get
      through. Write down about four pages of that stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stunned I was for a moment at his audacity. Too plainly I saw through his
      deception. Each day, doubtless, he had come to a low place of this sort
      and copied into the notebook from the printed volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; I protested, &ldquo;why not at least go to the gallery where these
      art objects are stored? Copy the notes there if that must be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where the darned place is,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;I did start for
      it the first day, but I run into a Punch and Judy show in a little park,
      and I just couldn&rsquo;t get away from it, it was so comical, with all the
      French kids hollering their heads off at it. Anyway, what&rsquo;s the use? I&rsquo;d
      rather set here in front of this saloon, where everything is nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very extraordinary, sir,&rdquo; I said, wondering if I oughtn&rsquo;t to cut off
      to the hotel and warn Mrs. Effie so that she might do a heated foot to
      him, as he had once expressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;ve got my rights as well as anybody,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      be pushed just so far and no farther, not if I never get any more cultured
      than a jack-rabbit. And now you better go on and write or I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;dashed&mdash;if
      I&rsquo;ll ever wear another thing you tell me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a most bitter and dangerous expression on his face, so I thought
      best to humour him once more. Accordingly I set about writing in his
      notebook from the volume of criticism he had supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Change a word now and then and skip around here and there,&rdquo; he suggested
      as I wrote, &ldquo;so&rsquo;s it&rsquo;ll sound more like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, sir,&rdquo; I said, and continued to transcribe from the printed
      page. I was beginning the fifth page in the notebook, being in the midst
      of an enthusiastic description of the bit of statuary entitled &ldquo;The Winged
      Victory,&rdquo; when I was startled by a wild yell in my ear. Cousin Egbert had
      leaped to his feet and now danced in the middle of the pavement, waving
      his stick and hat high in the air and shouting incoherently. At once we
      attracted the most undesirable attention from the loungers about us, the
      waiters and the passers-by in the street, many of whom stopped at once to
      survey my charge with the liveliest interest. It was then I saw that he
      had merely wished to attract the attention of some one passing in a cab.
      Half a block down the boulevard I saw a man likewise waving excitedly,
      standing erect in the cab to do so. The cab thereupon turned sharply, came
      back on the opposite side of the street, crossed over to us, and the
      occupant alighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an American, as one might have fancied from his behaviour, a tall,
      dark-skinned person, wearing a drooping moustache after the former style
      of Cousin Egbert, supplemented by an imperial. He wore a loose-fitting
      suit of black which had evidently received no proper attention from the
      day he purchased it. Under a folded collar he wore a narrow cravat tied in
      a bowknot, and in the bosom of his white shirt there sparkled a diamond
      such as might have come from a collection of crown-jewels. This much I had
      time to notice as he neared us. Cousin Egbert had not ceased to shout, nor
      had he paid the least attention to my tugs at his coat. When the cab&rsquo;s
      occupant descended to the pavement they fell upon each other and did for
      some moments a wild dance such as I imagine they might have seen the red
      Indians of western America perform. Most savagely they punched each other,
      calling out in the meantime: &ldquo;Well, old horse!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d ever expected
      to see you here, darn your old skin!&rdquo; (Their actual phrases, be it
      remembered.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd, I was glad to note, fell rapidly away, many of them shrugging
      their shoulders in a way the French have, and even the waiters about us
      quickly lost interest in the pair, as if they were hardened to the sight
      of Americans greeting one another. The two were still saying: &ldquo;Well!
      well!&rdquo; rather breathlessly, but had become a bit more coherent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeff Tuttle, you&mdash;dashed&mdash;old long-horn!&rdquo; exclaimed Cousin
      Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old Sour-dough!&rdquo; exploded the other. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t this just like old home
      week!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought mebbe you wouldn&rsquo;t know me with all my beadwork and my new
      war-bonnet on,&rdquo; continued Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know you, why, you knock-kneed old Siwash, I could pick out your hide in
      a tanyard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well!&rdquo; replied Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well!&rdquo; said the other, and again they dealt each other smart
      blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you turn up from?&rdquo; demanded Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Europe,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;We been all over Europe and Italy&mdash;just
      come from some place up over the divide where they talk Dutch, the Madam
      and the two girls and me, with the Reverend Timmins and his wife riding
      line on us. Say, he&rsquo;s an out-and-out devil for cathedrals&mdash;it&rsquo;s just
      one church after another with him&mdash;Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian,
      Lutheran, takes &lsquo;em all in&mdash;never overlooks a bet. He&rsquo;s got Addie and
      the girls out now. My gosh! it&rsquo;s solemn work! Me? I ducked out this
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told the little woman I had to have a tooth pulled&mdash;I was working it
      up on the train all day yesterday. Say, what you all rigged out like that
      for, Sour-dough, and what you done to your face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert here turned to me in some embarrassment. &ldquo;Colonel Ruggles,
      shake hands with my friend Jeff Tuttle from the State of Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleased to meet you, Colonel,&rdquo; said the other before I could explain that
      I had no military title whatever, never having, in fact, served our King,
      even in the ranks. He shook my hand warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any friend of Sour-dough Floud&rsquo;s is all right with me,&rdquo; he assured me.
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with having a drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, listen here! I wouldn&rsquo;t have to be blinded and backed into it,&rdquo; said
      Cousin Egbert, enigmatically, I thought, but as they sat down I, too,
      seated myself. Something within me had sounded a warning. As well as I
      know it now I knew then in my inmost soul that I should summon Mrs. Effie
      before matters went farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beer is all I know how to say,&rdquo; suggested Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave that to me,&rdquo; said his new friend masterfully. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the boy?
      Here, boy! Veesky-soda! That&rsquo;s French for high-ball,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      had to pick up a lot of their lingo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert looked at him admiringly. &ldquo;Good old Jeff!&rdquo; he said simply.
      He glanced aside to me for a second with downright hostility, then turned
      back to his friend. &ldquo;Something tells me, Jeff, that this is going to be
      the first happy day I&rsquo;ve had since I crossed the state line. I&rsquo;ve been
      pestered to death, Jeff&mdash;what with Mrs. Effie after me to improve
      myself so&rsquo;s I can be a social credit to her back in Red Gap, and learn to
      wear clothes and go without my breakfast and attend art galleries. If
      you&rsquo;d stand by me I&rsquo;d throw her down good and hard right now, but you know
      what she is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sure do,&rdquo; put in Mr. Tuttle so fervently that I knew he spoke the
      truth. &ldquo;That woman can bite through nails. But here&rsquo;s your drink,
      Sour-dough. Maybe it will cheer you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Extraordinary! I mean to say, biting through nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three rousing cheers!&rdquo; exclaimed Cousin Egbert with more animation than I
      had ever known him display.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s looking at you, Colonel,&rdquo; said his friend to me, whereupon I
      partook of the drink, not wishing to offend him. Decidedly he was not
      vogue. His hat was remarkable, being of a black felt with high crown and a
      wide and flopping brim. Across his waistcoat was a watch-chain of heavy
      links, with a weighty charm consisting of a sculptured gold horse in full
      gallop. That sort of thing would never do with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, George,&rdquo; he immediately called to the waiter, for they had quickly
      drained their glasses, &ldquo;tell the bartender three more. By gosh! but that&rsquo;s
      good, after the way I&rsquo;ve been held down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know how to say it in French.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Reverend held me down,&rdquo; continued the Tuttle person. &ldquo;&lsquo;A glass of
      native wine,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;may perhaps be taken now and then without harm.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;leave us have ales, wines, liquors, and cigars,&rsquo; I says,
      but not him. I&rsquo;d get a thimbleful of elderberry wine or something about
      every second Friday, except when I&rsquo;d duck out the side door of a church
      and find some caffy. Here, George, foomer, foomer&mdash;bring us some
      seegars, and then stay on that spot&mdash;I may want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert again, as if the meeting were still
      incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You old stinging-lizard!&rdquo; responded the other affectionately. The cigars
      were brought and I felt constrained to light one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The State of Washington needn&rsquo;t ever get nervous over the prospect of
      losing me,&rdquo; said the Tuttle person, biting off the end of his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gathered at once that the Americans have actually named one of our
      colonies &ldquo;Washington&rdquo; after the rebel George Washington, though one would
      have thought that the indelicacy of this would have been only too
      apparent. But, then, I recalled, as well, the city where their so-called
      parliament assembles, Washington, D. C. Doubtless the initials indicate
      that it was named in &ldquo;honour&rdquo; of another member of this notorious family.
      I could not but reflect how shocked our King would be to learn of this
      effrontery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert, who had been for some moments moving his lips without
      sound, here spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try it myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here, Charley, veesky-soda! He
      made me right off,&rdquo; he continued as the waiter disappeared. &ldquo;Say, Jeff, I
      bet I could have learned a lot of this language if I&rsquo;d had some one like
      you around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it took me some time to get the accent,&rdquo; replied the other with a
      modesty which I could detect was assumed. More acutely than ever was I
      conscious of a psychic warning to separate these two, and I resolved to
      act upon it with the utmost diplomacy. The third whiskey and soda was
      served us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three rousing cheers!&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s looking at you!&rdquo; said the other, and I drank. When my glass was
      drained I arose briskly and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we should be getting along now, sir, if Mr. Tuttle will be good
      enough to excuse us.&rdquo; They both stared at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;I fancy not, sir,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop your kidding, you fat rascal!&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Bill means all right,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert, &ldquo;so don&rsquo;t let him irritate
      you. Bill&rsquo;s our new hired man. He&rsquo;s all right&mdash;just let him talk
      along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t he talk setting down?&rdquo; asked the other. &ldquo;Does he have to stand up
      every time he talks? Ain&rsquo;t that a good chair?&rdquo; he demanded of me. &ldquo;Here,
      take mine,&rdquo; and to my great embarrassment he arose and offered me his
      chair in such a manner that I felt moved to accept it. Thereupon he took
      the chair I had vacated and beamed upon us, &ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;re all
      home-folks, together once more, I would suggest a bit of refreshment. Boy,
      veesky-soda!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy so, sir,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert, dreamily contemplating me as the
      order was served. I was conscious even then that he seemed to be studying
      my attire with a critical eye, and indeed he remarked as if to himself:
      &ldquo;What a coat!&rdquo; I was rather shocked by this, for my suit was quite a
      decent lounge-suit that had become too snug for the Honourable George some
      two years before. Yet something warned me to ignore the comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three rousing cheers!&rdquo; he said as the drink was served.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s looking at you!&rdquo; said the Tuttle person.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again I drank with them, against my better judgment, wondering if I
      might escape long enough to be put through to Mrs. Floud on the telephone.
      Too plainly the situation was rapidly getting out of hand, and yet I
      hesitated. The Tuttle person under an exterior geniality was rather
      abrupt. And, moreover, I now recalled having observed a person much like
      him in manner and attire in a certain cinema drama of the far Wild West.
      He had been a constable or sheriff in the piece and had subdued a band of
      armed border ruffians with only a small pocket pistol. I thought it as
      well not to cross him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had drunk, each one again said, &ldquo;Well! well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You old maverick!&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;dashed&mdash;old horned toad!&rdquo; responded his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with a little snack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing on earth. My appetite ain&rsquo;t been so powerful craving since
      Heck was a pup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were their actual words, though it may not be believed. The Tuttle
      person now approached his cabman, who had waited beside the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Frank,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;Ally restorong,&rdquo; and this he supplemented with a
      crude but informing pantomime of one eating. Cousin Egbert was already
      seated in the cab, and I could do nothing but follow. &ldquo;Ally restorong!&rdquo;
       commanded our new friend in a louder tone, and the cabman with an
      explosion of understanding drove rapidly off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a genuine wonder to me how you learned the language so quick,&rdquo; said
      Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in the accent,&rdquo; protested the other. I occupied a narrow seat in
      the front. Facing me in the back seat, they lolled easily and smoked their
      cigars. Down the thronged boulevard we proceeded at a rapid pace and were
      passing presently before an immense gray edifice which I recognized as the
      so-called Louvre from its illustration on the cover of Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s art
      book. He himself regarded it with interest, though I fancy he did not
      recognize it, for, waving his cigar toward it, he announced to his friend:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Public Library.&rdquo; His friend surveyed the building with every sign of
      approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Carnegie is a hot sport, all right,&rdquo; he declared warmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet
      that shack set him back some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three rousing cheers!&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert, without point that I could
      detect.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now crossed their Thames over what would have been Westminster Bridge,
      I fancy, and were presently bowling through a sort of Battersea part of
      the city. The streets grew quite narrow and the shops smaller, and I found
      myself wondering not without alarm what sort of restaurant our abrupt
      friend had chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three rousing cheers!&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert from time to time, with almost
      childish delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Debouching from a narrow street again into what the French term a
      boulevard, we halted before what was indeed a restaurant, for several
      tables were laid on the pavement before the door, but I saw at once that
      it was anything but a nice place. &ldquo;Au Rendezvous des Cochers Fideles,&rdquo;
       read the announcement on the flap of the awning, and truly enough it was a
      low resort frequented by cabbies&mdash;&ldquo;The meeting-place of faithful
      coachmen.&rdquo; Along the curb half a score of horses were eating from their
      bags, while their drivers lounged before the place, eating, drinking, and
      conversing excitedly in their grotesque jargon.
    </p>
    <p>
      We descended, in spite of the repellent aspect of the place, and our
      driver went to the foot of the line, where he fed his own horse. Cousin
      Egbert, already at one of the open-air tables, was rapping smartly for a
      waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with having just one little one before grub?&rdquo; asked the
      Tuttle person as we joined him. He had a most curious fashion of speech. I
      mean to say, when he suggested anything whatsoever he invariably wished to
      know what might be the matter with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Veesky-soda!&rdquo; demanded Cousin Egbert of the serving person who now
      appeared, &ldquo;and ask your driver to have one,&rdquo; he then urged his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter hereupon addressed the cabman who had now come up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vooley-voos take something!&rdquo; he demanded, and the cabman appeared to
      accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vooley-voos your friends take something, too?&rdquo; he demanded further, with
      a gesture that embraced all the cabmen present, and these, too, appeared
      to accept with the utmost cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wonder, Jeff,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;You talk it like a
      professor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It come natural to me,&rdquo; said the fellow, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a good thing, too. If
      you know a little French you can go all over Europe without a bit of
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inside the place was all activity, for many cabmen were now accepting the
      proffered hospitality, and calling &ldquo;votry santy!&rdquo; to their host, who
      seemed much pleased. Then to my amazement Cousin Egbert insisted that our
      cabman should sit at table with us. I trust I have as little foolish pride
      as most people, but this did seem like crowding it on a bit thick. In
      fact, it looked rather dicky. I was glad to remember that we were in what
      seemed to be the foreign quarter of the town, where it was probable that
      no one would recognize us. The drink came, though our cabman refused the
      whiskey and secured a bottle of native wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three rousing cheers!&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert as we drank once more, and
      added as an afterthought, &ldquo;What a beautiful world we live in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vooley-voos make-um bring dinner!&rdquo; said the Tuttle person to the cabman,
      who thereupon spoke at length in his native tongue to the waiter. By this
      means we secured a soup that was not half bad and presently a stew of
      mutton which Cousin Egbert declared was &ldquo;some goo.&rdquo; To my astonishment I
      ate heartily, even in such raffish surroundings. In fact, I found myself
      pigging it with the rest of them. With coffee, cigars were brought from
      the tobacconist&rsquo;s next-door, each cabman present accepting one. Our own
      man was plainly feeling a vast pride in his party, and now circulated
      among his fellows with an account of our merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what I call life,&rdquo; said the Tuttle person, leaning back in his
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming right back here every day,&rdquo; declared Cousin Egbert happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with a little drive to see some well-known objects of
      interest?&rdquo; inquired his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not art galleries,&rdquo; insisted Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not churches,&rdquo; said his friend. &ldquo;Every day&rsquo;s been Sunday with me long
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not clothing stores,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert firmly. &ldquo;The Colonel here is
      awful fussy about my clothes,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is, heh?&rdquo; inquired his friend. &ldquo;How do you like this hat of mine?&rdquo; he
      asked, turning to me. It was that sudden I nearly fluffed the catch, but
      recovered myself in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should consider it a hat of sound wearing properties, sir,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it off, examined it carefully, and replaced it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far, so good,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;But why be fussy about clothes when
      God has given you only one life to live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t argue about religion,&rdquo; warned Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always like to see people well dressed, sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;because it makes
      such a difference in their appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slapped his thigh fiercely. &ldquo;My gosh! that&rsquo;s true. He&rsquo;s got you there,
      Sour-dough. I never thought of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He makes me wear these chest-protectors on my ankles,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert
      bitterly, extending one foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter of taking a little drive to see some well-known objects
      of interest?&rdquo; said his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not art galleries,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We said that before&mdash;and not churches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not gents&rsquo; furnishing goods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said that before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you said not churches before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter with taking a little drive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not art galleries,&rdquo; insisted Cousin Egbert. The thing seemed
      interminable. I mean to say, they went about the circle as before. It
      looked to me as if they were having a bit of a spree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have one last drink,&rdquo; said the Tuttle person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert firmly, &ldquo;not another drop. Don&rsquo;t you see the
      condition poor Bill here is in?&rdquo; To my amazement he was referring to me.
      Candidly, he was attempting to convey the impression that I had taken a
      drop too much. The other regarded me intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pickled,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always affects him that way,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got no head for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; I said, wishing to explain, but this I was not let to
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start anything like that here,&rdquo; broke in the Tuttle person, &ldquo;the
      police wouldn&rsquo;t stand for it. Just keep quiet and remember you&rsquo;re among
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; quite so, sir,&rdquo; said I, being somewhat puzzled by these strange
      words. &ldquo;I was merely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, Jeff,&rdquo; warned Cousin Egbert, interrupting me; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a devil
      when he starts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got a knife?&rdquo; demanded the other suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy so, sir,&rdquo; I answered, and produced from my waistcoat pocket the
      small metal-handled affair I have long carried. This he quickly seized
      from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can keep your gun,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t be trusted with this
      in your condition. I ain&rsquo;t afraid of a gun, but I am afraid of a knife.
      You could have backed me off the board any time with this knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rdquo; asked Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; I began, for this was drawing it quite too thick, but
      again he interrupted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get him away from this place right off,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A drive in the fresh air might fix him,&rdquo; suggested Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      as good a scout as you want to know when he&rsquo;s himself.&rdquo; Hereupon, calling
      our waiting cabman, they both, to my embarrassment, assisted me to the
      vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ally caffy!&rdquo; directed the Tuttle person, and we were driven off, to the
      raised hats of the remaining cabmen, through many long, quiet streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have had this happen for anything,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert,
      indicating me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky I got that knife away from him,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this I thought it best to remain silent, it being plain that the men
      were both well along, so to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab now approached an open square from which issued discordant blasts
      of music. One glance showed it to be a street fair. I prayed that we might
      pass it, but my companions hailed it with delight and at once halted the
      cabby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ally caffy on the corner,&rdquo; directed the Tuttle person, and once more we
      were seated at an iron table with whiskey and soda ordered. Before us was
      the street fair in all its silly activity. There were many tinselled
      booths at which games of chance or marksmanship were played, or at which
      articles of ornament or household decoration were displayed for sale, and
      about these were throngs of low-class French idling away their afternoon
      in that mad pursuit of pleasure which is so characteristic of this race.
      In the centre of the place was a carrousel from which came the blare of a
      steam orchestrion playing the &ldquo;Marseillaise,&rdquo; one of their popular songs.
      From where I sat I could perceive the circle of gaudily painted beasts
      that revolved about this musical atrocity. A fashion of horses seemed to
      predominate, but there was also an ostrich (a bearded Frenchman being
      astride this bird for the moment), a zebra, a lion, and a gaudily
      emblazoned giraffe. I shuddered as I thought of the evil possibilities
      that might be suggested to my two companions by this affair. For the
      moment I was pleased to note that they had forgotten my supposed
      indisposition, yet another equally absurd complication ensued when the
      drink arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t your friend ever loosen up?&rdquo; asked the Tuttle person of Cousin
      Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tighter than Dick&rsquo;s hatband,&rdquo; replied the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then some! He ain&rsquo;t bought once. Say, Bo,&rdquo; he continued to me as I
      was striving to divine the drift of these comments, &ldquo;have I got my fingers
      crossed or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that he held one hand behind him I thought to humour him by saying,
      &ldquo;I fancy so, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He means &lsquo;yes,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other held his hand before me with the first two fingers spread wide
      apart. &ldquo;You lost,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that, Sour-dough? We stuck him the
      first rattle out of the box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good work,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re stuck for this round,&rdquo; he added
      to me. &ldquo;Three rousing cheers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I readily perceived that they meant me to pay the score, which I
      accordingly did, though I at once suspected the fairness of the game. I
      mean to say, if my opponent had been a trickster he could easily have
      rearranged his fingers to defeat me before displaying them. I do not say
      it was done in this instance. I am merely pointing out that it left open a
      way to trickery. I mean to say, one would wish to be assured of his
      opponent&rsquo;s social standing before playing this game extensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had we finished the drink than the Tuttle person said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you one chance to get even. I&rsquo;ll guess your fingers this time.&rdquo;
       Accordingly I put one hand behind me and firmly crossed the fingers,
      fancying that he would guess them to be uncrossed. Instead of which he
      called out &ldquo;Crossed,&rdquo; and I was obliged to show them in that wise, though,
      as before pointed out, I could easily have defeated him by uncrossing them
      before revealing my hand. I mean to say, it is not on the face of it a
      game one would care to play with casual acquaintances, and I questioned
      even then in my own mind its prevalence in the States. (As a matter of
      fact, I may say that in my later life in the States I could find no trace
      of it, and now believe it to have been a pure invention on the part of the
      Tuttle person. I mean to say, I later became convinced that it was,
      properly speaking, not a game at all.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Again they were hugely delighted at my loss and rapped smartly on the
      table for more drink, and now to my embarrassment I discovered that I
      lacked the money to pay for this &ldquo;round&rdquo; as they would call it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; said I discreetly to Cousin Egbert, &ldquo;but if you could
      let me have a bit of change, a half-crown or so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; To my
      surprise he regarded me coldly and shook his head emphatically in the
      negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been had too often. You&rsquo;re a good smooth talker
      and you may be all right, but I can&rsquo;t take a chance at my time of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he want now?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old story,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert: &ldquo;come off and left his purse on the
      hatrack or out in the woodshed some place.&rdquo; This was the height of
      absurdity, for I had said nothing of the sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was looking for something like that,&rdquo; said the other &ldquo;I never make a
      mistake in faces. You got a watch there haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; I said, and laid on the table my silver English half-hunter
      with Albert. They both fell to examining this with interest, and presently
      the Tuttle person spoke up excitedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, darn my skin if he ain&rsquo;t got a genuine double Gazottz. How did you
      come by this, my man?&rdquo; he demanded sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It came from my brother-in-law, sir,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;six years ago as
      security for a trifling loan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sounds honest enough,&rdquo; said the Tuttle person to Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but maybe it ain&rsquo;t a regular double Gazottz,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;The
      market is flooded with imitations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I can&rsquo;t be fooled on them boys,&rdquo; insisted the other. &ldquo;Blindfold
      me and I could pick a double Gazottz out every time. I&rsquo;m going to take a
      chance on it, anyway.&rdquo; Whereupon the fellow pocketed my watch and from his
      wallet passed me a note of the so-called French money which I was
      astounded to observe was for the equivalent of four pounds, or one hundred
      francs, as the French will have it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll advance that much on it,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t ask for another cent until I&rsquo;ve had it thoroughly gone
      over by a plumber. It may have moths in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me that the chap was quite off his head, for the watch was
      worth not more than ten shillings at the most, though what a double
      Gazottz might be I could not guess. However, I saw it would be wise to
      appear to accept the loan, and tendered the note in payment of the score.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had secured the change I sought to intimate that we should be
      leaving. I thought even the street fair would be better for us than this
      rapid consumption of stimulants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet he&rsquo;d go without buying,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;He knows what&rsquo;s customary in a case
      like this. He&rsquo;s just a little embarrassed. Wait and see if I ain&rsquo;t right.&rdquo;
       At which they both sat and stared at me in silence for some moments until
      at last I ordered more drink, as I saw was expected of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants the cabman to have one with him,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert, whereat
      the other not only beckoned our cabby to join us, but called to two
      labourers who were passing, and also induced the waiter who served us to
      join in the &ldquo;round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to have a lot of tough friends,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert as we all
      drank, though he well knew I had extended none of these invitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Acts like a drunken sailor soon as he gets a little money,&rdquo; said the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three rousing cheers!&rdquo; replied Cousin Egbert, and to my great chagrin he
      leaped to his feet, seized one of the navvies about the waist, and there
      on the public pavement did a crude dance with him to the strain of the
      &ldquo;Marseillaise&rdquo; from the steam orchestrion. Not only this, but when the
      music had ceased he traded hats with the navvy, securing a most shocking
      affair in place of the new one, and as they parted he presented the fellow
      with the gloves and stick I had purchased for him that very morning. As I
      stared aghast at this <i>faux pas</i> the navvy, with his new hat at an
      angle and twirling the stick, proceeded down the street with mincing steps
      and exaggerated airs of gentility, to the applause of the entire crowd,
      including Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t quite the hat I want,&rdquo; he said as he returned to us, &ldquo;but the
      day is young. I&rsquo;ll have other chances,&rdquo; and with the help of the
      public-house window as a mirror he adjusted the unmentionable thing with
      affectations of great nicety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He always was a dressy old scoundrel,&rdquo; remarked the Tuttle person. And
      then, as the music came to us once more, he continued: &ldquo;Say, Sour-dough,
      let&rsquo;s go over to the rodeo&mdash;they got some likely looking broncs over
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arm in arm, accordingly, they crossed the street and proceeded to the
      carrousel, first warning the cabby and myself to stay by them lest harm
      should come to us. What now ensued was perhaps their most remarkable
      behaviour at the day. At the time I could account for it only by the
      liquor they had consumed, but later experience in the States convinced me
      that they were at times consciously spoofing. I mean to say, it was quite
      too absurd&mdash;their seriously believing what they seemed to believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carrousel being at rest when we approached, they gravely examined each
      one of the painted wooden effigies, looking into such of the mouths as
      were open, and cautiously feeling the forelegs of the different mounts,
      keeping up an elaborate pretence the while that the beasts were real and
      that they were in danger of being kicked. One absurdly painted horse they
      agreed would be the most difficult to ride. Examining his mouth, they
      disputed as to his age, and called the cabby to have his opinion of the
      thing&rsquo;s fetlocks, warning each other to beware of his rearing. The cabby,
      who was doubtless also intoxicated, made an equal pretence of the beast&rsquo;s
      realness, and indulged, I gathered, in various criticisms of its legs at
      great length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; remarked the Tuttle person when the cabby had
      finished. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad case of splints. The leg would be blistered if I had
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t give him corral room,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bad actor.
      Look at his eye! Whoa! there&mdash;you would, would you!&rdquo; Here he made a
      pretence that the beast had seized him by the shoulder. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a man-eater!
      What did I tell you? Keep him away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that out of him,&rdquo; said the Tuttle person. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show him who&rsquo;s
      his master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t never going to try to ride him, Jeff? Think of the wife and
      little ones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know me, Sour-dough. No horse never stepped out from under me yet.
      I&rsquo;ll not only ride him, but I&rsquo;ll put a silver dollar in each stirrup and
      give you a thousand for each one I lose and a thousand for every time I
      touch leather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert here began to plead tearfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, Jeff&mdash;come on around here. There&rsquo;s a big five-year-old
      roan around here that will be safe as a church for you. Let that pinto
      alone. They ought to be arrested for having him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the other seemed obdurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Start her up, Professor, when I give the word!&rdquo; he called to the
      proprietor, and handed him one of the French banknotes. &ldquo;Play it all out!&rdquo;
       he directed, as this person gasped with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert then proceeded to the head of the beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to blind him,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; replied the other, and with loud and profane cries to the animal
      they bound a handkerchief about his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell he&rsquo;s going to be a twister,&rdquo; warned Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;I better
      ear him,&rdquo; and to my increased amazement he took one of the beast&rsquo;s leather
      ears between his teeth and held it tightly. Then with soothing words to
      the supposedly dangerous animal, the Tuttle person mounted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him go!&rdquo; he called to Cousin Egbert, who released the ear from
      between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; called the latter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all going with you,&rdquo; whereupon he
      insisted that the cabby and I should enter a sort of swan-boat directly in
      the rear. I felt a silly fool, but I saw there was nothing else to be
      done. Cousin Egbert himself mounted a horse he had called a &ldquo;blue roan,&rdquo;
       waved his hand to the proprietor, who switched a lever, the &ldquo;Marseillaise&rdquo;
       blared forth, and the platform began to revolve. As we moved, the Tuttle
      person whisked the handkerchief from off the eyes of his mount and with
      loud, shrill cries began to beat the sides of its head with his soft hat,
      bobbing about in his saddle, moreover, as if the beast were most unruly
      and like to dismount him. Cousin Egbert joined in the yelling, I am sorry
      to say, and lashed his beast as if he would overtake his companion. The
      cabman also became excited and shouted his utmost, apparently in the way
      of encouragement. Strange to say, I presume on account of the motion, I
      felt the thing was becoming infectious and was absurdly moved to join in
      the shouts, restraining myself with difficulty. I could distinctly imagine
      we were in the hunting field and riding the tails off the hounds, as one
      might say.
    </p>
    <p>
      In view of what was later most unjustly alleged of me, I think it as well
      to record now that, though I had partaken freely of the stimulants since
      our meeting with the Tuttle person, I was not intoxicated, nor until this
      moment had I felt even the slightest elation. Now, however, I did begin to
      feel conscious of a mild exhilaration, and to be aware that I was viewing
      the behaviour of my companions with a sort of superior but amused
      tolerance. I can account for this only by supposing that the swift
      revolutions of the carrousel had in some occult manner intensified or
      consummated, as one might say, the effect of my previous potations. I mean
      to say, the continued swirling about gave me a frothy feeling that was not
      unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the contrivance came to rest, Cousin Egbert ran to the Tuttle person,
      who had dismounted, and warmly shook his hand, as did the cabby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly thought he had you there once, Jeff,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;Of
      all the twisters I ever saw, that outlaw is the worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanted to roll me,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;but I learned him something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may not be credited, but at this moment I found myself examining the
      beast and saying: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s crocked himself up, sir&mdash;he&rsquo;s gone tender at
      the heel.&rdquo; I knew perfectly, it must be understood, that this was silly,
      and yet I further added, &ldquo;I fancy he&rsquo;s picked up a stone.&rdquo; I mean to say,
      it was the most utter rot, pretending seriously that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come away,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;Next thing you&rsquo;ll be thinking you
      can ride him yourself.&rdquo; I did in truth experience an earnest craving for
      more of the revolutions and said as much, adding that I rode at twelve
      stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him break his neck if he wants to,&rdquo; urged the Tuttle person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be right,&rdquo; replied Cousin Egbert, &ldquo;not in his condition.
      Let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t find something gentle for him. Not the roan&mdash;I
      found she ain&rsquo;t bridle-wise. How about that pheasant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ostrich, sir,&rdquo; I corrected him, as indeed it most distinctly was,
      though at my words they both indulged in loud laughter, affecting to
      consider that I had misnamed the creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ostrich!&rdquo; they shouted. &ldquo;Poor old Bill&mdash;he thinks it&rsquo;s an ostrich!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, sir,&rdquo; I said, pleasantly but firmly, determining not to be
      hoaxed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drivel that way,&rdquo; said the Tuttle person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it to the driver, Jeff&mdash;maybe he&rsquo;ll believe <i>him</i>,&rdquo; said
      Cousin Egbert almost sadly, whereupon the other addressed the cabby:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Frank,&rdquo; he began, and continued with some French words, among which
      I caught &ldquo;vooley-vous, ally caffy, foomer&rdquo;; and something that sounded
      much like &ldquo;kafoozleum,&rdquo; at which the cabby spoke at some length in his
      native language concerning the ostrich. When he had done, the Tuttle
      person turned to me with a superior frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I guess you&rsquo;re satisfied,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;You heard what Frank said&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      an Arabian muffin bird.&rdquo; Of course I was perfectly certain that the chap
      had said nothing of the sort, but I resolved to enter into the spirit of
      the thing, so I merely said: &ldquo;Yes, sir; my error; it was only at first
      glance that it seemed to be an ostrich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let him ride anything he can&rsquo;t
      guess the name of. It wouldn&rsquo;t be right to his folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s that, then?&rdquo; demanded the other, pointing full at the
      giraffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bally ant-eater, sir,&rdquo; I replied, divining that I should be wise
      not to seem too obvious in naming the beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, so it is!&rdquo; exclaimed the Tuttle person delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the eye with him this time,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sure a wonder,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;That thing had me fooled; I thought
      at first it was a Russian mouse hound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let him ride it, then,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert, and I was practically
      lifted into the saddle by the pair of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see the poor thing has a sore
      throat? Wait till I fix him.&rdquo; And forthwith he removed his spats and in
      another moment had buckled them securely high about the throat of the
      giraffe. It will be seen that I was not myself when I say that this
      performance did not shock me as it should have done, though I was, of
      course, less entertained by it than were the remainder of our party and a
      circle of the French lower classes that had formed about us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him his head! Let&rsquo;s see what time you can make!&rdquo; shouted Cousin
      Egbert as the affair began once more to revolve. I saw that both my
      companions held opened watches in their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It here becomes difficult for me to be lucid about the succeeding events
      of the day. I was conscious of a mounting exhilaration as my beast swept
      me around the circle, and of a marked impatience with many of the
      proprieties of behaviour that ordinarily with me matter enormously. I
      swung my cap and joyously urged my strange steed to a faster pace, being
      conscious of loud applause each time I passed my companions. For certain
      lapses of memory thereafter I must wholly blame this insidious motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, though I believed myself to be still mounted and whirling
      (indeed I was strongly aware of the motion), I found myself seated again
      at the corner public house and rapping smartly for drink, which I paid
      for. I was feeling remarkably fit, and suffered only a mild wonder that I
      should have left the carrousel without observing it. Having drained my
      glass, I then remember asking Cousin Egbert if he would consent to change
      hats with the cabby, which he willingly did. It was a top-hat of some
      strange, hard material brightly glazed. Although many unjust things were
      said of me later, this is the sole incident of the day which causes me to
      admit that I might have taken a glass too much, especially as I
      undoubtedly praised Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s appearance when the exchange had been
      made, and was heard to wish that we might all have hats so smart.

    <p>
      It was directly after this that young Mr. Elmer, the art student, invited
      us to his studio, though I had not before remarked his presence, and
      cannot recall now where we met him. The occurrence in the studio, however,
      was entirely natural. I wished to please my friends and made no demur
      whatever when asked to don the things&mdash;a trouserish affair, of
      sheep&rsquo;s wool, which they called &ldquo;chapps,&rdquo; a flannel shirt of blue (they
      knotted a scarlet handkerchief around my neck), and a wide-brimmed white
      hat with four indentations in the crown, such as one may see worn in the
      cinema dramas by cow-persons and other western-coast desperadoes. When
      they had strapped around my waist a large pistol in a leather jacket, I
      considered the effect picturesque in the extreme, and my friends were loud
      in their approval of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I repeat, it was an occasion when it would have been boorish in me to
      refuse to meet them halfway. I even told them an excellent wheeze I had
      long known, which I thought they might not, have heard. It runs: &ldquo;Why is
      Charing Cross? Because the Strand runs into it.&rdquo; I mean to say, this is
      comic providing one enters wholly into the spirit of it, as there is
      required a certain nimbleness of mind to get the point, as one might say.
      In the present instance some needed element was lacking, for they actually
      drew aloof from me and conversed in low tones among themselves, pointedly
      ignoring me. I repeated the thing to make sure they should see it, whereat
      I heard Cousin Egbert say. &ldquo;Better not irritate him&mdash;he&rsquo;ll get mad if
      we don&rsquo;t laugh,&rdquo; after which they burst into laughter so extravagant that
      I knew it to be feigned. Hereupon, feeling quite drowsy, I resolved to
      have forty winks, and with due apologies reclined upon the couch, where I
      drifted into a refreshing slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later I inferred that I must have slept for some hours. I was awakened by
      a light flashed in my eyes, and beheld Cousin Egbert and the Tuttle
      person, the latter wishing to know how late I expected to keep them up. I
      was on my feet at once with apologies, but they instantly hustled me to
      the door, down a flight of steps, through a court-yard, and into the
      waiting cab. It was then I noticed that I was wearing the curious hat of
      the American Far-West, but when I would have gone back to leave it, and
      secure my own, they protested vehemently, wishing to know if I had not
      given them trouble enough that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cab I was still somewhat drowsy, but gathered that my companions
      had left me, to dine and attend a public dance-hall with the cubbish art
      student. They had not seemed to need sleep and were still wakeful, for
      they sang from time to time, and Cousin Egbert lifted the cabby&rsquo;s hat,
      which he still wore, bowing to imaginary throngs along the street who were
      supposed to be applauding him. I at once became conscience-stricken at the
      thought of Mrs. Effie&rsquo;s feelings when she should discover him to be in
      this state, and was on the point of suggesting that he seek another
      apartment for the night, when the cab pulled up in front of our own hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I protest that I was now entirely recovered from any effect that
      the alcohol might have had upon me, it was not until this moment that I
      most horribly discovered myself to be in the full cow-person&rsquo;s regalia I
      had donned in the studio in a spirit of pure frolic. I mean to say, I had
      never intended to wear the things beyond the door and could not have been
      hired to do so. What was my amazement then to find my companions
      laboriously lifting me from the cab in this impossible tenue. I objected
      vehemently, but little good it did me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get a policeman if he starts any of that rough stuff,&rdquo; said the Tuttle
      person, and in sheer horror of a scandal I subsided, while one on either
      side they hustled me through the hotel lounge&mdash;happily vacant of
      every one but a tariff manager&mdash;and into the lift. And now I
      perceived that they were once more pretending to themselves that I was in
      a bad way from drink, though I could not at once suspect the full iniquity
      of their design.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we reached our own floor, one of them still seeming to support me on
      either side, they began loud and excited admonitions to me to be still, to
      come along as quickly as possible, to stop singing, and not to shoot. I
      mean to say, I was entirely quiet, I was coming along as quickly as they
      would let me, I had not sung, and did not wish to shoot, yet they
      persisted in making this loud ado over my supposed intoxication, aimlessly
      as I thought, until the door of the Floud drawing-room opened and Mrs.
      Effie appeared in the hallway. At this they redoubled their absurd
      violence with me, and by dint of tripping me they actually made it appear
      that I was scarce able to walk, nor do I imagine that the costume I wore
      was any testimonial to my sobriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we got him safe,&rdquo; panted Cousin Egbert, pushing open the door of my
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get his gun, first!&rdquo; warned the Tuttle person, and this being taken from
      me, I was unceremoniously shoved inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does all this mean?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Effie, coming rapidly down the
      hall. &ldquo;Where have you been till this time of night? I bet it&rsquo;s your fault,
      Jeff Tuttle&mdash;you&rsquo;ve been getting him going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were both voluble with denials of this, and though I could scarce
      believe my ears, they proceeded to tell a story that laid the blame
      entirely on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, Mis&rsquo; Effie,&rdquo; began the Tuttle person. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t that way at
      all. You wrong me if ever a man was wronged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just seen what state he was in, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Cousin Egbert in
      tones of deep injury. &ldquo;Do you want to take another look at him?&rdquo; and he
      made as if to push the door farther open upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it&mdash;don&rsquo;t get him started again!&rdquo; warned the Tuttle person.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had trouble enough with that man to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seen it coming this morning,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert, &ldquo;when we was at the
      art gallery. He had a kind of wild look in his eyes, and I says right
      then: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a man ought to be watched,&rsquo; and, well, one thing led to
      another&mdash;look at this hat he made me wear&mdash;nothing would satisfy
      him but I should trade hats with some cab-driver&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was coming along from looking at two or three good churches,&rdquo; broke in
      the Tuttle person, &ldquo;when I seen Sour-dough here having a kind of a mix-up
      with this man because of him insisting he must ride a kangaroo or
      something on a merry-go-round, and wanting Sour-dough to ride an ostrich
      with him, and then when we got him quieted down a little, nothing would do
      him but he&rsquo;s got to be a cowboy&mdash;you seen his clothes, didn&rsquo;t you?
      And of course I wanted to get back to Addie and the girls, but I seen
      Sour-dough here was in trouble, so I stayed right by him, and between us
      we got the maniac here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of them should never touch liquor,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert; &ldquo;it
      makes a demon of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got his knife away from him early in the game,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I got to wear this cabman&rsquo;s hat just because he told me
      to, have I?&rdquo; demanded Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here I&rsquo;d been looking forward to a quiet day seeing some well-known
      objects of interest,&rdquo; came from the other, &ldquo;after I got my tooth pulled,
      that is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And me with a tooth, too, that nearly drove me out of my mind,&rdquo; said
      Cousin Egbert suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not see Mrs. Effie, but she had evidently listened to this
      outrageous tale with more or less belief, though not wholly credulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You men have both been drinking yourselves,&rdquo; she said shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had to take a little; he made us,&rdquo; declared the Tuttle person
      brazenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got so he insisted on our taking something every time he did,&rdquo; added
      Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;And, anyway, I didn&rsquo;t care so much, with this tooth of
      mine aching like it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come right out with me and around to that dentist I went to this
      morning,&rdquo; said the Tuttle person. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll suffer all night if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert, &ldquo;though I hate to leave this
      comfortable hotel and go out into the night air again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the right of this in the morning,&rdquo; said Mrs. Effie. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      think it&rsquo;s going to stop here!&rdquo; At this my door was pulled to and the key
      turned in the lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankly I am aware that what I have put down above is incredible, yet not
      a single detail have I distorted. With a quite devilish ingenuity they had
      fastened upon some true bits: I had suggested the change of hats with the
      cabby, I had wished to ride the giraffe, and the Tuttle person had secured
      my knife, but how monstrously untrue of me was the impression conveyed by
      these isolated facts. I could believe now quite all the tales I had ever
      heard of the queerness of Americans. Queerness, indeed! I went to bed
      resolving to let the morrow take care of itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I was awakened by a light flashing in my eyes, and became aware that
      Cousin Egbert stood in the middle of the room. He was reading from his
      notebook of art criticisms, with something of an oratorical effect.
      Through the half-drawn curtains I could see that dawn was breaking. Cousin
      Egbert was no longer wearing the cabby&rsquo;s hat. It was now the flat cap of
      the Paris constable or policeman.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FOUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sight was a fair crumpler after the outrageous slander that had been
      put upon me by this elderly inebriate and his accomplice. I sat up at
      once, prepared to bully him down a bit. Although I was not sure that I
      engaged his attention, I told him that his reading could be very well done
      without and that he might take himself off. At this he became silent and
      regarded me solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did Charing Cross the Strand? Because three rousing cheers,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he had the wheeze all wrong and I saw that he should be in bed.
      So with gentle words I lured him to his own chamber. Here, with a quite
      unexpected perversity, he accused me of having kept him up the night long
      and begged now to be allowed to retire. This he did with muttered
      complaints of my behaviour, and was almost instantly asleep. I concealed
      the constable&rsquo;s cap in one of his boxes, for I feared that he had not come
      by this honestly. I then returned to my own room, where for a long time I
      meditated profoundly upon the situation that now confronted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed probable that I should be shopped by Mrs. Effie for what she had
      been led to believe was my rowdyish behaviour. However dastardly the
      injustice to me, it was a solution of the problem that I saw I could bring
      myself to meet with considerable philosophy. It meant a return to the
      quiet service of the Honourable George and that I need no longer face the
      distressing vicissitudes of life in the back blocks of unexplored America.
      I would not be obliged to muddle along in the blind fashion of the last
      two days, feeling a frightful fool. Mrs. Effie would surely not keep me
      on, and that was all about it. I had merely to make no defence of myself.
      And even if I chose to make one I was not certain that she would believe
      me, so cunning had been the accusations against me, with that tiny thread
      of fact which I make no doubt has so often enabled historians to give a
      false colouring to their recitals without stating downright untruths.
      Indeed, my shameless appearance in the garb of a cow person would alone
      have cast doubt upon the truth as I knew it to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly I suffered an illumination. I perceived all at once that to
      make any sort of defence of myself would not be cricket. I mean to say, I
      saw the proceedings of the previous day in a new light. It is well known
      that I do not hold with the abuse of alcoholic stimulants, and yet on the
      day before, in moments that I now confess to have been slightly elevated,
      I had been conscious of a certain feeling of fellowship with my two
      companions that was rather wonderful. Though obviously they were not
      university men, they seemed to belong to what in America would be called
      the landed gentry, and yet I had felt myself on terms of undoubted
      equality with them. It may be believed or not, but there had been brief
      spaces when I forgot that I was a gentleman&rsquo;s man. Astoundingly I had
      experienced the confident ease of a gentleman among his equals. I was
      obliged to admit now that this might have been a mere delusion of the cup,
      and yet I wondered, too, if perchance I might not have caught something of
      that American spirit of equality which is said to be peculiar to
      republics. Needless to say I had never believed in the existence of this
      spirit, but had considered it rather a ghastly jest, having been a reader
      of our own periodical press since earliest youth. I mean to say, there
      could hardly be a stable society in which one had no superiors, because in
      that case one would not know who were one&rsquo;s inferiors. Nevertheless, I
      repeat that I had felt a most novel enlargement of myself; had, in fact,
      felt that I was a gentleman among gentlemen, using the word in its
      strictly technical sense. And so vividly did this conviction remain with
      me that I now saw any defence of my course to be out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      I perceived that my companions had meant to have me on toast from the
      first. I mean to say, they had started a rag with me&mdash;a bit of chaff&mdash;and
      I now found myself rather preposterously enjoying the manner in which they
      had chivied me. I mean to say, I felt myself taking it as one gentleman
      would take a rag from other gentlemen&mdash;not as a bit of a sneak who
      would tell the truth to save his face. A couple of chaffing old beggars
      they were, but they had found me a topping dead sportsman of their own
      sort. Be it remembered I was still uncertain whether I had caught
      something of that alleged American spirit, or whether the drink had made
      me feel equal at least to Americans. Whatever it might be, it was rather
      great, and I was prepared to face Mrs. Effie without a tremor&mdash;to
      face her, of course, as one overtaken by a weakness for spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the bell at last rang I donned my service coat and, assuming a look
      of profound remorse, I went to the drawing-room to serve the morning
      coffee. As I suspected, only Mrs. Effie was present. I believe it has been
      before remarked that she is a person of commanding presence, with a manner
      of marked determination. She favoured me with a brief but chilling glance,
      and for some moments thereafter affected quite to ignore me. Obviously she
      had been completely greened the night before and was treating me with a
      proper contempt. I saw that it was no use grousing at fate and that it was
      better for me not to go into the American wilderness, since a rolling
      stone gathers no moss. I was prepared to accept instant dismissal without
      a character.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began upon me, however, after her first cup of coffee, more mildly
      than I had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruggles, I&rsquo;m horribly disappointed in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more so than I myself, Madam,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am more disappointed,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;because I felt that Cousin
      Egbert had something in him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something in him, yes, Madam,&rdquo; I murmured sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that you were the man to bring it out. I was quite hopeful after you
      got him into those new clothes. I don&rsquo;t believe any one else could have
      done it. And now it turns out that you have this weakness for drink. Not
      only that, but you have a mania for insisting that other men drink with
      you. Think of those two poor fellows trailing you over Paris yesterday
      trying to save you from yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forget it, Madam,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t believe that Jeff Tuttle always has to have it forced
      on him. Jeff Tuttle is an Indian. But Cousin Egbert is different. You tore
      him away from that art gallery where he was improving his mind, and led
      him into places that must have been disgusting to him. All he wanted was
      to study the world&rsquo;s masterpieces in canvas and marble, yet you put a
      cabman&rsquo;s hat on him and made him ride an antelope, or whatever the thing
      was. I can&rsquo;t think where you got such ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not myself. I can only say that I seemed to be subject to an
      attack.&rdquo; And the Tuttle person was one of their Indians! This explained so
      much about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look like a periodical souse,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, Madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must be a wonder when you do start. The point is: am I doing
      right to intrust Cousin Egbert to you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, Madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems doubtful if you are the person to develop his higher nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Against my better judgment I here felt obliged to protest that I had
      always been given the highest character for quietness and general
      behaviour and that I could safely promise that I should be guilty of no
      further lapses of this kind. Frankly, I was wishing to be shopped, and yet
      I could not resist making this mild defence of myself. Such I have found
      to be the way of human nature. To my surprise I found that Mrs. Effie was
      more than half persuaded by these words and was on the point of giving me
      another trial. I cannot say that I was delighted at this. I was ready to
      give up all Americans as problems one too many for me, and yet I was
      strangely a little warmed at thinking I might not have seen the last of
      Cousin Egbert, whom I had just given a tuckup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have your chance,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;and just to show you that
      I&rsquo;m not narrow, you can go over to the sideboard there and pour yourself
      out a little one. It ought to be a lifesaver to you, feeling the way you
      must this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Madam,&rdquo; and I did as she suggested. I was feeling especially
      fit, but I knew that I ought to play in character, as one might say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three rousing cheers!&rdquo; I said, having gathered the previous day that this
      was a popular American toast. She stared at me rather oddly, but made no
      comment other than to announce her departure on a shopping tour. Her
      bonnet, I noted, was quite wrong. Too extremely modish it was, accenting
      its own lines at the expense of a face to which less attention should have
      been called. This is a mistake common to the sex, however. They little
      dream how sadly they mock and betray their own faces. Nothing I think is
      more pathetic than their trustful unconsciousness of the tragedy&mdash;the
      rather plainish face under the contemptuous structure that points to it
      and shrieks derision. The rather plain woman who knows what to put upon
      her head is a woman of genius. I have seen three, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now went to the room of Cousin Egbert. I found him awake and cheerful,
      but disinclined to arise. It was hard for me to realize that his simple,
      kindly face could mask the guile he had displayed the night before. He
      showed no sign of regret for the false light in which he had placed me.
      Indeed he was sitting up in bed as cheerful and independent as if he had
      paid two-pence for a park chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that we ought to spend a peaceful day indoors. The
      trouble with these foreign parts is that they don&rsquo;t have enough home life.
      If it isn&rsquo;t one thing it&rsquo;s another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s both, sir,&rdquo; I said, and he saw at once that I was not to
      be wheedled. Thereupon he grinned brazenly at me, and demanded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;she was highly indignant at me for taking you and
      Mr. Tuttle into public houses and forcing you to drink liquor, but she was
      good enough, after I had expressed my great regret and promised to do
      better in the future, to promise that I should have another chance. It was
      more than I could have hoped, sir, after the outrageous manner in which I
      behaved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grinned again at this, and in spite of my resentment I found myself
      grinning with him. I am aware that this was a most undignified submission
      to the injustice he had put upon me, and it was far from the line of stern
      rebuke that I had fully meant to adopt with him, but there seemed no other
      way. I mean to say, I couldn&rsquo;t help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you talk that way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It shows you may have
      something in you after all. What you want to do is to learn to say no.
      Then you won&rsquo;t be so much trouble to those who have to look after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I shall try, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll give you another chance,&rdquo; he said sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mean to say, it was all spoofing, the way we talked. I am certain he
      knew it as well as I did, and I am sure we both enjoyed it. I am not one
      of those who think it shows a lack of dignity to unbend in this manner on
      occasion. True, it is not with every one I could afford to do so, but
      Cousin Egbert seemed to be an exception to almost every rule of conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his earnest request I now procured for him another carafe of iced water
      (he seemed already to have consumed two of these), after which he
      suggested that I read to him. The book he had was the well-known story,
      &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe,&rdquo; and I began a chapter which describes some of the
      hero&rsquo;s adventures on his lonely island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert, I was glad to note, was soon sleeping soundly, so I left
      him and retired to my own room for a bit of needed rest. The story of
      &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rdquo; is one in which many interesting facts are conveyed
      regarding life upon remote islands where there are practically no modern
      conveniences and one is put to all sorts of crude makeshifts, but for me
      the narrative contains too little dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the remainder of the day I was left to myself, a period of peace that
      I found most welcome. Not until evening did I meet any of the family
      except Cousin Egbert, who partook of some light nourishment late in the
      afternoon. Then it was that Mrs. Effie summoned me when she had dressed
      for dinner, to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are sailing for home the day after to-morrow. See that Cousin Egbert
      has everything he needs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The following day was a busy one, for there were many boxes to be packed
      against the morrow&rsquo;s sailing, and much shopping to do for Cousin Egbert,
      although he was much against this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all nonsense,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;her saying all that truck helps to
      &lsquo;finish&rsquo; me. Look at me! I&rsquo;ve been in Europe darned near four months and I
      can&rsquo;t see that I&rsquo;m a lick more finished than when I left Red Gap. Of
      course it may show on me so other people can see it, but I don&rsquo;t believe
      it does, at that.&rdquo; Nevertheless, I bought him no end of suits and smart
      haberdashery.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last box had been strapped I hastened to our old lodgings on the
      chance of seeing the Honourable George once more. I found him dejectedly
      studying an ancient copy of the &ldquo;Referee.&rdquo; Too evidently he had dined that
      night in a costume which would, I am sure, have offended even Cousin
      Egbert. Above his dress trousers he wore a golfing waistcoat and a
      shooting jacket. However, I could not allow myself to be distressed by
      this. Indeed, I knew that worse would come. I forebore to comment upon the
      extraordinary choice of garments he had made. I knew it was quite useless.
      From any word that he let fall during our chat, he might have supposed
      himself to be dressed as an English gentleman should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bade me seat myself, and for some time we smoked our pipes in a
      friendly silence. I had feared that, as on the last occasion, he would row
      me for having deserted him, but he no longer seemed to harbour this unjust
      thought. We spoke of America, and I suggested that he might some time come
      out to shoot big game along the Ohio or the Mississippi. He replied
      moodily, after a long interval, that if he ever did come out it would be
      to set up a cattle plantation. It was rather agreed that he would come
      should I send for him. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t sit around forever waiting for old Nevil&rsquo;s
      toast crumbs,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      We chatted for a time of home politics, which was, of course, in a
      wretched state. There was a time when we might both have been won to a
      sane and reasoned liberalism, but the present so-called government was
      coming it a bit too thick for us. We said some sharp things about the
      little Welsh attorney who was beginning to be England&rsquo;s humiliation. Then
      it was time for me to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment was rather awkward, for the Honourable George, to my great
      embarrassment, pressed upon me his dispatch-case, one that we had carried
      during all our travels and into which tidily fitted a quart flask. Brandy
      we usually carried in it. I managed to accept it with a word of thanks,
      and then amazingly he shook hands twice with me as we said good-night. I
      had never dreamed he could be so greatly affected. Indeed, I had always
      supposed that there was nothing of the sentimentalist about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Honourable George and I were definitely apart for the first time in
      our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with mingled emotions that I set sail next day for the foreign land
      to which I had been exiled by a turn of the cards. Not only was I off to a
      wilderness where a life of daily adventure was the normal life, but I was
      to mingle with foreigners who promised to be quite almost impossibly
      queer, if the family of Flouds could be taken as a sample of the native
      American&mdash;knowing Indians like the Tuttle person; that sort of thing.
      If some would be less queer, others would be even more queer, with
      queerness of a sort to tax even my <i>savoir faire</i>, something which
      had been sorely taxed, I need hardly say, since that fatal evening when
      the Honourable George&rsquo;s intuitions had played him false in the game of
      drawing poker. I was not the first of my countrymen, however, to find
      himself in desperate straits, and I resolved to behave as England expects
      us to.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that I was viewing the prospect with mingled emotions. Before
      we had been out many hours they became so mingled that, having crossed the
      Channel many times, I could no longer pretend to ignore their true nature.
      For three days I was at the mercy of the elements, and it was then I
      discovered a certain hardness in the nature of Cousin Egbert which I had
      not before suspected. It was only by speaking in the sharpest manner to
      him that I was able to secure the nursing my condition demanded. I made no
      doubt he would actually have left me to the care of a steward had I not
      been firm with him. I have known him leave my bedside for an hour at a
      time when it seemed probable that I would pass away at any moment. And
      more than once, when I summoned him in the night to administer one of the
      remedies with which I had provided myself, or perhaps to question him if
      the ship were out of danger, he exhibited something very like irritation.
      Indeed he was never properly impressed by my suffering, and at times when
      he would answer my call it was plain to be seen that he had been passing
      idle moments in the smoke-room or elsewhere, quite as if the situation
      were an ordinary one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only fair to say, however, that toward the end of my long and
      interesting illness I had quite broken his spirit and brought him to be as
      attentive as even I could wish. By the time I was able with his assistance
      to go upon deck again he was bringing me nutritive wines and jellies
      without being told, and so attentive did he remain that I overheard a
      fellow-passenger address him as Florence Nightingale. I also overheard the
      Senator tell him that I had got his sheep, whatever that may have meant&mdash;a
      sheep or a goat&mdash;some domestic animal. Yet with all his willingness
      he was clumsy in his handling of me; he seemed to take nothing with any
      proper seriousness, and in spite of my sharpest warning he would never
      wear the proper clothes, so that I always felt he was attracting undue
      attention to us. Indeed, I should hardly care to cross with him again, and
      this I told him straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the so-called joys of ship-life, concerning which the boat companies
      speak so enthusiastically in their folders, the less said the better. It
      is a childish mind, I think, that can be impressed by the mere wabbly bulk
      of water. It is undoubtedly tremendous, but nothing to kick up such a row
      about. The truth is that the prospect from a ship&rsquo;s deck lacks that
      variety which one may enjoy from almost any English hillside. One sees
      merely water, and that&rsquo;s all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be understood, therefore, that I hailed our approach to the shores
      of foreign America with relief if not with enthusiasm. Even this was
      better than an ocean which has only size in its favour and has been quite
      too foolishly overrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were soon steaming into the harbour of one of their large cities.
      Chicago, I had fancied it to be, until the chance remark of an American
      who looked to be a well-informed fellow identified it as New York. I was
      much annoyed now at the behaviour of Cousin Egbert, who burst into silly
      cheers at the slightest excuse, a passing steamer, a green hill, or a
      rusty statue of quite ungainly height which seemed to be made of crude
      iron. Do as I would, I could not restrain him from these unseemly shouts.
      I could not help contrasting his boisterousness with the fine reserve
      which, for example, the Honourable George would have maintained under
      these circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      A further relief it was, therefore, when we were on the dock and his mind
      was diverted to other matters. A long time we were detained by customs
      officials who seemed rather overwhelmed by the gowns and millinery of Mrs.
      Effie, but we were at last free and taken through the streets of the crude
      new American city of New York to a hotel overlooking what I dare say in
      their simplicity they call their Hyde Park.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FIVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      I must admit that at this inn they did things quite nicely, doubtless
      because it seemed to be almost entirely staffed by foreigners. One would
      scarce have known within its walls that one had come out to North America,
      nor that savage wilderness surrounded one on every hand. Indeed I was
      surprised to learn that we were quite at the edge of the rough Western
      frontier, for in but one night&rsquo;s journey we were to reach the American
      mountains to visit some people who inhabited a camp in their dense wilds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bit of romantic thrill I felt in this adventure, for we should
      encounter, I inferred, people of the hardy pioneer stock that has pushed
      the American civilization, such as it is, ever westward. I pictured the
      stalwart woodsman, axe in hand, braving the forest to fell trees for his
      rustic home, while at night the red savages prowled about to scalp any who
      might stray from the blazing campfire. On the day of our landing I had
      read something of this&mdash;of depredations committed by their Indians at
      Arizona.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what would, I take it, be their Victoria station, we three began our
      journey in one of the Pullman night coaches, the Senator of this family
      having proceeded to their home settlement of Red Gap with word that he
      must &ldquo;look after his fences,&rdquo; referring, doubtless, to those about his
      cattle plantation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As our train moved out Mrs. Effie summoned me for a serious talk
      concerning the significance of our present visit; not of the wilderness
      dangers to which we might be exposed, but of its social aspects, which
      seemed to be of prime importance. We were to visit, I learned, one Charles
      Belknap-Jackson of Boston and Red Gap, he being a person who mattered
      enormously, coming from one of the very oldest families of Boston, a port
      on their east coast, and a place, I gathered, in which some decent
      attention is given to the matter of who has been one&rsquo;s family. A bit of a
      shock it was to learn that in this rough land they had their castes and
      precedences. I saw I had been right to suspect that even a crude society
      could not exist without its rules for separating one&rsquo;s superiors from the
      lower sorts. I began to feel at once more at home and I attended the
      discourse of Mrs. Effie with close attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boston person, in one of those irresponsibly romantic moments that
      sometimes trap the best of us, had married far beneath him, espousing the
      simple daughter of one of the crude, old-settling families of Red Gap.
      Further, so inattentive to details had he been, he had neglected to secure
      an ante-nuptial settlement as our own men so wisely make it their rule to
      do, and was now suffering a painful embarrassment from this folly; for the
      mother-in-law, controlling the rather sizable family fortune, had harshly
      insisted that the pair reside in Red Gap, permitting no more than an
      occasional summer visit to his native Boston, whose inhabitants she
      affected not to admire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course the poor fellow suffers frightfully,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Effie,
      &ldquo;shut off there away from all he&rsquo;d been brought up to, but good has come
      of it, for his presence has simply done wonders for us. Before he came our
      social life was too awful for words&mdash;oh, a <i>mixture</i>!
      Practically every one in town attended our dances; no one had ever told us
      any better. The Bohemian set mingled freely with the very oldest families&mdash;oh,
      in a way that would never be tolerated in London society, I&rsquo;m sure. And
      everything so crude! Why, I can remember when no one thought of putting
      doilies under the finger-bowls. No tone to it at all. For years we had no
      country club, if you can believe that. And even now, in spite of the
      efforts of Charles and a few of us, there are still some of the older
      families that are simply sloppy in their entertaining. And promiscuous.
      The trouble I&rsquo;ve had with the Senator and Cousin Egbert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Flouds are an old family?&rdquo; I suggested, wishing to understand these
      matters deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Flouds,&rdquo; she answered impressively, &ldquo;were living in Red Gap before
      the spur track was ever run out to the canning factory&mdash;and I guess
      you know what that means!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, Madam,&rdquo; I suggested; and, indeed, though it puzzled me a bit,
      it sounded rather tremendous, as meaning with us something like since the
      battle of Hastings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, as I say, Charles at once gave us a glimpse of the better things.
      Thanks to him, the Bohemian set and the North Side set are now fairly
      distinct. The scraps we&rsquo;ve had with that Bohemian set! He has a real
      genius for leadership, Charles has, but I know he often finds it so
      discouraging, getting people to know their places. Even his own
      mother-in-law, Mrs. Lysander John Pettengill&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll see
      to-morrow how impossible she is, poor old soul! I shouldn&rsquo;t talk about
      her, I really shouldn&rsquo;t. Awfully good heart the poor old dear has, but&mdash;well,
      I don&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t tell you the exact truth in plain words&mdash;you&rsquo;d
      find it out soon enough. She is simply a confirmed <i>mixer</i>. The trial
      she&rsquo;s been and is to poor Charles! Almost no respect for any of the higher
      things he stands for&mdash;and temper? Well, I&rsquo;ve heard her swear at him
      till you&rsquo;d have thought it was Jeff Tuttle packing a green cayuse for the
      first time. Words? Talk about words! And Cousin Egbert always standing in
      with her. He&rsquo;s been another awful trial, refusing to play tennis at the
      country club, or to take up golf, or do any of those smart things, though
      I got him a beautiful lot of sticks. But no: when he isn&rsquo;t out in the
      hills, he&rsquo;d rather sit down in that back room at the Silver Dollar saloon,
      playing cribbage all day with a lot of drunken loafers. But I&rsquo;m so hoping
      that will be changed, now that I&rsquo;ve made him see there are better things
      in life. Don&rsquo;t you really think he&rsquo;s another man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To an extent, Madam, I dare say,&rdquo; I replied cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s chiefly what I got you for,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;And then, in a general
      way you will give tone to our establishment. The moment I saw you I knew
      you could be an influence for good among us. No one there has ever had
      anything like you. Not even Charles. He&rsquo;s tried to have American valets,
      but you never can get them to understand their place. Charles finds them
      so offensively familiar. They don&rsquo;t seem to realize. But of course you
      realize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I inclined my head in sympathetic understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to Charles meeting you. I guess he&rsquo;ll be a little put
      out at our having you, but there&rsquo;s no harm letting him see I&rsquo;m to be
      reckoned with. Naturally his wife, Millie, is more or less mentioned as a
      social leader, but I never could see that she is really any more prominent
      than I am. In fact, last year after our Bazaar of All Nations our pictures
      in costume were in the Spokane paper as &lsquo;Red Gap&rsquo;s Rival Society Queens,&rsquo; 
      and I suppose that&rsquo;s what we are, though we work together pretty well as a
      rule. Still, I must say, having you puts me a couple of notches ahead of
      her. Only, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, keep your eye on Cousin Egbert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do my duty, Madam,&rdquo; I returned, thinking it all rather morbidly
      interesting, these weird details about their county families.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you will,&rdquo; she said at parting. &ldquo;I feel that we shall do things
      right this year. Last year the Sunday Spokane paper used to have nearly a
      column under the heading &lsquo;Social Doings of Red Gap&rsquo;s Smart Set.&rsquo; This year
      we&rsquo;ll have a good two columns, if I don&rsquo;t miss my guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the smoking-compartment I found Cousin Egbert staring gloomily into
      vacancy, as one might say, the reason I knew being that he had vainly
      pleaded with Mrs. Effie to be allowed to spend this time at their Coney
      Island, which is a sort of Brighton. He transferred his stare to me, but
      it lost none of its gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell begins to pop!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Referring to what, sir?&rdquo; I rejoined with some severity, for I have never
      held with profanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Referring to Charles Belknap Hyphen Jackson of Boston, Mass.,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;the greatest little trouble-maker that ever crossed the hills&mdash;with
      a bracelet on one wrist and a watch on the other and a one-shot eyeglass
      and a gold cigareet case and key chains, rings, bangles, and jewellery
      till he&rsquo;d sink like lead if he ever fell into the crick with all that
      metal on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are speaking, sir, about a person who matters enormously,&rdquo; I rebuked
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t been afraid of getting arrested I&rsquo;d have shot him long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not done, sir,&rdquo; I said, quite horrified by his rash words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s liable to be,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;I bet Ma Pettengill will go in with me
      on it any time I give her the word. Say, listen! there&rsquo;s one good mixer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The confirmed Mixer, sir?&rdquo; For I remembered the term.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best ever. Any one can set into her game that&rsquo;s got a stack of
      chips.&rdquo; He uttered this with deep feeling, whatever it might exactly mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can be pushed just so far,&rdquo; he insisted sullenly. It struck me then
      that he should perhaps have been kept longer in one of the European
      capitals. I feared his brief contact with those refining influences had
      left him less polished than Mrs. Effie seemed to hope. I wondered uneasily
      if he might not cause her to miss her guess. Yet I saw he was in no mood
      to be reasoned with, and I retired to my bed which the blackamoor guard
      had done out. Here I meditated profoundly for some time before I slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning found our coach shunted to a siding at a backwoods settlement on
      the borders of an inland sea. The scene was wild beyond description, where
      quite almost anything might be expected to happen, though I was a bit
      reassured by the presence of a number of persons of both sexes who
      appeared to make little of the dangers by which we were surrounded. I mean
      to say since they thus took their women into the wilds so freely, I would
      still be a dead sportsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a brief wait at a rude quay we embarked on a launch and steamed out
      over the water. Mile after mile we passed wooded shores that sloped up to
      mountains of prodigious height. Indeed the description of the Rocky
      Mountains, of which I take these to be a part, have not been overdrawn.
      From time to time, at the edge of the primeval forest, I could make out
      the rude shelters of hunter and trapper who braved these perils for the
      sake of a scanty livelihood for their hardy wives and little ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert, beside me, seemed unimpressed, making no outcry at the
      fearsome wildness of the scene, and when I spoke of the terrific height of
      the mountains he merely admonished me to &ldquo;quit my kidding.&rdquo; The sole
      interest he had thus far displayed was in the title of our craft&mdash;<i>Storm
      King</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of the guy&rsquo;s imagination, naming this here chafing dish the <i>Storm
      King</i>!&rdquo; said he; but I was impatient of levity at so solemn a moment,
      and promptly rebuked him for having donned a cravat that I had warned him
      was for town wear alone; whereat he subsided and did not again intrude
      upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far ahead, at length, I could descry an open glade at the forest edge, and
      above this I soon spied floating the North American flag, or national
      emblem. It is, of course, known to us that the natives are given to making
      rather a silly noise over this flag of theirs, but in this instance&mdash;the
      pioneer fighting his way into the wilderness and hoisting it above his
      frontier home&mdash;I felt strangely indisposed to criticise. I understood
      that he could be greatly cheered by the flag of the country he had left
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now neared a small dock from which two ladies brandished handkerchiefs
      at us, and were presently welcomed by them. I had no difficulty in
      identifying the Mrs. Charles Belknap-Jackson, a lively featured brunette
      of neutral tints, rather stubby as to figure, but modishly done out in
      white flannels. She surveyed us interestedly through a lorgnon, observing
      which Mrs. Effie was quick with her own. I surmised that neither of them
      was skilled with this form of glass (which must really be raised with an
      air or it&rsquo;s no good); also that each was not a little chagrined to note
      that the other possessed one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was it less evident that the other lady was the mother of Mrs.
      Belknap-Jackson; I mean to say, the confirmed Mixer&mdash;an elderly
      person of immense bulk in gray walking-skirt, heavy boots, and a flowered
      blouse that was overwhelming. Her face, under her grayish thatch of hair,
      was broad and smiling, the eyes keen, the mouth wide, and the nose rather
      a bit blobby. Although at every point she was far from vogue, she
      impressed me not unpleasantly. Even her voice, a magnificently hoarse
      rumble, was primed with a sort of uncouth good-will which one might accept
      in the States. Of course it would never do with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fancied I could at once detect why they had called her the &ldquo;Mixer.&rdquo; She
      embraced Mrs. Effie with an air of being about to strangle the woman; she
      affectionately wrung the hands of Cousin Egbert, and had grasped my own
      tightly before I could evade her, not having looked for that sort of
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s man!&rdquo; called Mrs. Effie. But even then the
      powerful creature would not release me until her daughter had called
      sharply, &ldquo;Maw! Don&rsquo;t you hear? He&rsquo;s a <i>man</i>!&rdquo; Nevertheless she gave
      my hand a parting shake before turning to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see a human face at last!&rdquo; she boomed. &ldquo;Here I&rsquo;ve been a month in
      this dinky hole,&rdquo; which I thought strange, since we were surrounded by
      league upon league of the primal wilderness. &ldquo;Cooped up like a hen in a
      barrel,&rdquo; she added in tones that must have carried well out over the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s man,&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Effie, a little ostentatiously, I
      thought. &ldquo;Poor Egbert&rsquo;s so dependent on him&mdash;quite helpless without
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert muttered sullenly to himself as he assisted me with the
      bags. Then he straightened himself to address them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won him in a game of freeze-out,&rdquo; he remarked quite viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he doll Sour-dough up like that all the time?&rdquo; demanded the Mixer,
      &ldquo;or has he just come from a masquerade? What&rsquo;s he represent, anyway?&rdquo; And
      these words when I had taken especial pains and resorted to all manner of
      threats to turn him smartly out in the walking-suit of a pioneer!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maw!&rdquo; cried our hostess, &ldquo;do try to forget that dreadful nickname of
      Egbert&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sure will if he keeps his disguise on,&rdquo; she rumbled back. &ldquo;The old
      horned toad is most as funny as Jackson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Really, I mean to say, they talked most amazingly. I was but too glad when
      they moved on and we could follow with the bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calls her &lsquo;Maw&rsquo; all right now,&rdquo; hissed Cousin Egbert in my ear, &ldquo;but when
      that begoshed husband of hers is around the house she calls her &lsquo;Mater.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone was vastly bitter. He continued to mutter sullenly to himself&mdash;a
      way he had&mdash;until we had disposed of the luggage and I was laying out
      his afternoon and evening wear in one of the small detached houses to
      which we had been assigned. Nor did he sink his grievance on the arrival
      of the Mixer a few moments later. He now addressed her as &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; and asked
      if she had &ldquo;the makings,&rdquo; which puzzled me until she drew from the pocket
      of her skirt a small cloth sack of tobacco and some bits of brown paper,
      from which they both fashioned cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The smart set of Red Gap is holding its first annual meeting for the
      election of officers back there,&rdquo; she began after she had emitted twin
      jets of smoke from the widely separated corners of her set mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, you know, where&rsquo;s Hyphen old top?&rdquo; demanded Cousin Egbert in a
      quite vile imitation of one speaking in the correct manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fishing,&rdquo; answered the Mixer with a grin. &ldquo;In a thousand dollars&rsquo; worth
      of clothes. These here Eastern trout won&rsquo;t notice you unless you dress
      right.&rdquo; I thought this strange indeed, but Cousin Egbert merely grinned in
      his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;d he get you into this awfully horrid rough place?&rdquo; he next demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Made him. &lsquo;This or Red Gap for yours,&rsquo; I says. The two weeks in New York
      wasn&rsquo;t so bad, what with Millie and me getting new clothes, though him and
      her both jumped on me that I&rsquo;m getting too gay about clothes for a party
      of my age. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s age to me,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;when I like bright colours?&rsquo; Then
      we tried his home-folks in Boston, but I played that string out in a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two old-maid sisters, thin noses and knitted shawls! Stick around in the
      back parlour talking about families&mdash;whether it was Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s
      Abigail or the Concord cousin&rsquo;s Hester that married an Adams in &lsquo;78 and
      moved out west to Buffalo. I thought first I could liven them up some, <i>you</i>
      know. Looked like it would help a lot for them to get out in a hack and
      get a few shots of hooch under their belts, stop at a few roadhouses, take
      in a good variety show; get &lsquo;em to feeling good, understand? No use.
      Wouldn&rsquo;t start. Darn it! they held off from me. Don&rsquo;t know why. I sure
      wore clothes for them. Yes, sir. I&rsquo;d get dressed up like a broken arm
      every afternoon; and, say, I got one sheath skirt, black and white
      striped, that just has to be looked at. Never phased them, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got to thinking mebbe it was because I made my own smokes instead of
      using those vegetable cigarettes of Jackson&rsquo;s, or maybe because I&rsquo;d get
      parched and demand a slug of booze before supper. Like a Sunday afternoon
      all the time, when you eat a big dinner and everybody&rsquo;s sleepy and mad
      because they can&rsquo;t take a nap, and have to set around and play a few
      church tunes on the organ or look through the album again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that right? Don&rsquo;t it fade you?&rdquo; murmured Cousin Egbert with deep
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And little Lysander, my only grandson, poor kid, getting the fidgets
      because they try to make him talk different, and raise hell every time he
      knocks over a vase or busts a window. Say, would you believe it? they
      wanted to keep him there&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;make him refined. Not for
      me! &lsquo;His father&rsquo;s about all he can survive in those respects,&rsquo; I says.
      What do you think? Wanted to let his hair grow so he&rsquo;d have curls. Some
      dames, yes? I bet they&rsquo;d have give the kid lovely days. &lsquo;Boston may be all
      O.K. for grandfathers,&rsquo; I says; &lsquo;not for grandsons, though.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Jackson was set on Bar Harbor, and I had to be firm again. Darn it!
      that man is always making me be firm. So here we are. He said it was a
      camp, and that sounded good. But my lands! he wears his full evening dress
      suit for supper every night, and you had ought to heard him go on one day
      when the patent ice-machine went bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good gosh!&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert quite simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had now finished laying out his things and was about to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he always like that?&rdquo; suddenly demanded the Mixer, pointing at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bill&rsquo;s all right when you get him out with a crowd,&rdquo; explained the
      other. &ldquo;Bill&rsquo;s really got the makings of one fine little mixer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both regarded me genially. It was vastly puzzling. I mean to say, I
      was at a loss how to take it, for, of course, that sort of thing would
      never do with us. And yet I felt a queer, confused sort of pleasure in the
      talk. Absurd though it may seem, I felt there might come moments in which
      America would appear almost not impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I went out Cousin Egbert was telling her of Paris. I lingered to hear
      him disclose that all Frenchmen have &ldquo;M&rdquo; for their first initial, and that
      the Louer family must be one of their wealthiest, the name &ldquo;A. Louer&rdquo;
       being conspicuous on millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of their real estate. This
      family, he said, must be like the Rothschilds. Of course the poor soul was
      absurdly wrong. I mean to say, the letter &ldquo;M&rdquo; merely indicates &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo;
       which is their foreign way of spelling Mister, while &ldquo;A Louer&rdquo; signifies
      &ldquo;to let.&rdquo; I resolved to explain this to him at the first opportunity, not
      thinking it right that he should spread such gross error among a race
      still but half-enlightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having now a bit of time to myself, I observed the construction of this
      rude homestead, a dozen or more detached or semi-detached structures of
      the native log, yet with the interiors more smartly done out than I had
      supposed was common even with the most prosperous of their scouts and
      trappers. I suspected a false idea of this rude life had been given by the
      cinema dramas. I mean to say, with pianos, ice-machines, telephones,
      objects of art, and servants, one saw that these woodsmen were not
      primitive in any true sense of the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler proved to be a genuine blackamoor, a Mr. Waterman, he informed
      me, his wife, also a black, being the cook. An elderly creature of the
      utmost gravity of bearing, he brought to his professional duties a finish,
      a dignity, a manner in short that I have scarce known excelled among our
      own serving people. And a creature he was of the most eventful past, as he
      informed me at our first encounter. As a slave he had commanded an
      immensely high price, some twenty thousand dollars, as the American money
      is called, and two prominent slaveholders had once fought a duel to the
      death over his possession. Not many, he assured me, had been so eagerly
      sought after, they being for the most part held cheaper&mdash;&ldquo;common
      black trash,&rdquo; he put it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early tiring of the life of slavery, he had fled to the wilds and for some
      years led a desperate band of outlaws whose crimes soon put a price upon
      his head. He spoke frankly and with considerable regret of these lawless
      years. At the outbreak of the American war, however, with a reward of
      fifty thousand dollars offered for his body, he had boldly surrendered to
      their Secretary of State for War, receiving a full pardon for his crimes
      on condition that he assist in directing the military operations against
      the slaveholding aristocracy. Invaluable he had been in this service, I
      gathered, two generals, named respectively Grant and Sherman, having
      repeatedly assured him that but for his aid they would more than once in
      sheer despair have laid down their swords.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could readily imagine that after these years of strife he had been glad
      to embrace the peaceful calling in which I found him engaged. He was, as I
      have intimated, a person of lofty demeanour, with a vein of high
      seriousness. Yet he would unbend at moments as frankly as a child and play
      at a simple game of chance with a pair of dice. This he was good enough to
      teach to myself and gained from me quite a number of shillings that I
      chanced to have. For his consort, a person of tremendous bulk named
      Clarice, he showed a most chivalric consideration, and even what I might
      have mistaken for timidity in one not a confessed desperado. In truth, he
      rather flinched when she interrupted our chat from the kitchen doorway by
      roundly calling him &ldquo;an old black liar.&rdquo; I saw that his must indeed be a
      complex nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this encounter I chanced upon two lads who seemed to present the
      marks of the backwoods life as I had conceived it. Strolling up a woodland
      path, I discovered a tent pitched among the trees, before it a smouldering
      campfire, over which a cooking-pot hung. The two lads, of ten years or so,
      rushed from the tent to regard me, both attired in shirts and leggings of
      deerskin profusely fringed after the manner in which the red Indians
      decorate their outing or lounge-suits. They were armed with sheath knives
      and revolvers, and the taller bore a rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy, stranger?&rdquo; exclaimed this one, and the other repeated the simple
      American phrase of greeting. Responding in kind, I was bade to seat myself
      on a fallen log, which I did. For some moments they appeared to ignore me,
      excitedly discussing an adventure of the night before, and addressing each
      other as Dead Shot and Hawk Eye. From their quaint backwoods speech I
      gathered that Dead Shot, the taller lad, had the day before been captured
      by a band of hostile redskins who would have burned him at the stake but
      for the happy chance that the chieftain&rsquo;s daughter had become enamoured of
      him and cut his bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now planned to return to the encampment at nightfall to fetch away
      the daughter, whose name was White Fawn, and cleaned and oiled their
      weapons for the enterprise. Dead Shot was vindictive in the extreme,
      swearing to engage the chieftain in mortal combat and to cut his heart
      out, the same chieftain in former years having led his savage band against
      the forest home of Dead Shot while he was yet too young to defend it, and
      scalped both of his parents. &ldquo;I was a mere stripling then, but now the
      coward will feel my steel!&rdquo; he coldly declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had become absurdly evident as I listened that the whole thing was but
      spoofing of a silly sort that lads of this age will indulge in, for I had
      seen the younger one take his seat at the luncheon table. But now they
      spoke of a raid on the settlement to procure &ldquo;grub,&rdquo; as the American slang
      for food has it. Bidding me stop on there and to utter the cry of the
      great horned owl if danger threatened, they stealthily crept toward the
      buildings of the camp. Presently came a scream, followed by a hoarse shout
      of rage. A second later the two dashed by me into the dense woods, Hawk
      Eye bearing a plucked fowl. Soon Mr. Waterman panted up the path
      brandishing a barge pole and demanding to know the whereabouts of the
      marauders. As he had apparently for the moment reverted to his primal
      African savagery, I deliberately misled him by indicating a false
      direction, upon which he went off, muttering the most frightful threats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two culprits returned, put their fowl in the pot to boil, and swore me
      eternal fidelity for having saved them. They declared I should thereafter
      be known as Keen Knife, and that, needing a service, I might call upon
      them freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead Shot never forgets a friend,&rdquo; affirmed the taller lad, whereupon I
      formally shook hands with the pair and left them to their childish
      devices. They were plotting as I left to capture &ldquo;that nigger,&rdquo; as they
      called him, and put him to death by slow torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was now shrewd enough to suspect that I might still be far from the
      western frontier of America. The evidence had been cumulative but was no
      longer questionable. I mean to say, one might do here somewhat after the
      way of our own people at a country house in the shires. I resolved at the
      first opportunity to have a look at a good map of our late colonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon our party gathered upon the small dock and I
      understood that our host now returned from his trouting. Along the shore
      of the lake he came, propelled in a native canoe by a hairy backwoods
      person quite wretchedly gotten up, even for a wilderness. Our host
      himself, I was quick to observe, was vogue to the last detail, with a
      sense of dress and equipment that can never be acquired, having to be born
      in one. As he stepped from his frail craft I saw that he was rather slight
      of stature, dark, with slender moustaches, a finely sensitive nose, and
      eyes of an almost austere repose. That he had much of the real manner was
      at once apparent. He greeted the Flouds and his own family with just that
      faint touch of easy superiority which would stamp him to the trained eye
      as one that really mattered. Mrs. Effie beckoned me to the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Ruggles take your things&mdash;Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s man,&rdquo; she was saying.
      After a startled glance at Cousin Egbert, our host turned to regard me
      with flattering interest for a moment, then transferred to me his oddments
      of fishing machinery: his rod, his creel, his luncheon hamper, landing
      net, small scales, ointment for warding off midges, a jar of cold cream, a
      case containing smoked glasses, a rolled map, a camera, a book of flies.
      As I was stowing these he explained that his sport had been wretched; no
      fish had been hooked because his guide had not known where to find them. I
      here glanced at the backwoods person referred to and at once did not like
      the look in his eyes. He winked swiftly at Cousin Egbert, who coughed
      rather formally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Ruggles help you to change,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Effie. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s awfully
      handy. Poor Cousin Egbert is perfectly helpless now without him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I followed our host to his own detached hut, though feeling a bit queer
      at being passed about in this manner, I mean to say, as if I were a basket
      of fruit. Yet I found it a grateful change to be serving one who knew our
      respective places and what I should do for him. His manner of speech,
      also, was less barbarous than that of the others, suggesting that he might
      have lived among our own people a fortnight or so and have tried earnestly
      to correct his deficiencies. In fact he remarked to me after a bit: &ldquo;I
      fancy I talk rather like one of yourselves, what?&rdquo; and was pleased as
      Punch when I assured him that I had observed this. He questioned me at
      length regarding my association with the Honourable George, and the houses
      at which we would have stayed, being immensely particular about names and
      titles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find us vastly different here,&rdquo; he said with a sigh, as I held his
      coat for him. &ldquo;Crude, I may say. In truth, Red Gap, where my interests
      largely confine me, is a town of impossible persons. You&rsquo;ll see in no time
      what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can already imagine it, sir,&rdquo; I said sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for want of example,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Scores of times I show them
      better ways, but they&rsquo;re eaten up with commercialism&mdash;money-grubbing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I perceived him to be a person of profound and interesting views, and it
      was with regret I left him to bully Cousin Egbert into evening dress. It
      is undoubtedly true that he will never wear this except it have the look
      of having been forced upon him by several persons of superior physical
      strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening passed in a refined manner with cards and music, the latter
      being emitted from a phonograph which I was asked to attend to and upon
      which I reproduced many of their quaint North American folksongs, such as
      &ldquo;Everybody Is Doing It,&rdquo; which has a rare native rhythm. At ten o&rsquo;clock,
      it being noticed by the three playing dummy bridge that Cousin Egbert and
      the Mixer were absent, I accompanied our host in search of them. In Cousin
      Egbert&rsquo;s hut we found them, seated at a bare table, playing at cards&mdash;a
      game called seven-upwards, I learned. Cousin Egbert had removed his coat,
      collar, and cravat, and his sleeves were rolled to his elbows like a
      navvy&rsquo;s. Both smoked the brown paper cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see?&rdquo; murmured Mr. Belknap-Jackson as we looked in upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, sir,&rdquo; I said discreetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mixer regarded her son-in-law with some annoyance, I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run off to bed, Jackson!&rdquo; she directed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re busy. I&rsquo;m putting a nick
      in Sour-dough&rsquo;s bank roll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our host turned away with a contemptuous shrug that I dare say might have
      offended her had she observed it, but she was now speaking to Cousin
      Egbert, who had stared at us brazenly.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Ring that bell for the coon, Sour-dough. I&rsquo;ll split a bottle of Scotch
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It queerly occurred to me that she made this monstrous suggestion in a
      spirit of bravado to annoy Mr. Belknap-Jackson.

      CHAPTER SIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are times when all Nature seems to smile, yet when to the sensitive
      mind it will be faintly brought that the possibilities are quite
      tremendously otherwise if one will consider them pro and con. I mean to
      say, one often suspects things may happen when it doesn&rsquo;t look so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The succeeding three days passed with so ordered a calm that little would
      any but a profound thinker have fancied tragedy to lurk so near their
      placid surface. Mrs. Effie and Mrs. Belknap-Jackson continued to plan the
      approaching social campaign at Red Gap. Cousin Egbert and the Mixer
      continued their card game for the trifling stake of a shilling a game, or
      &ldquo;two bits,&rdquo; as it is known in the American monetary system. And our host
      continued his recreation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each morning I turned him out in the smartest of fishing costumes and each
      evening I assisted him to change. It is true I was now compelled to
      observe at these times a certain lofty irritability in his character, yet
      I more than half fancied this to be queerly assumed in order to inform me
      that he was not unaccustomed to services such as I rendered him. There was
      that about him. I mean to say, when he sharply rebuked me for clumsiness
      or cried out &ldquo;Stupid!&rdquo; it had a perfunctory languor, as if meant to show
      me he could address a servant in what he believed to be the grand manner.
      In this, to be sure, he was so oddly wrong that the pathos of it quite
      drowned what I might otherwise have felt of resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I next observed that he was sharp in the same manner with the hairy
      backwoods person who took him to fish each day, using words to him which
      I, for one, would have employed, had I thought them merited, only after
      the gravest hesitation. I have before remarked that I did not like the
      gleam in this person&rsquo;s eyes: he was very apparently a not quite nice
      person. Also I more than once observed him to wink at Cousin Egbert in an
      evil manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have so truly said, how close may tragedy be to us when life seems
      most correct! It was Belknap-Jackson&rsquo;s custom to raise a view halloo each
      evening when he returned down the lake, so that we might gather at the
      dock to oversee his landing. I must admit that he disembarked with
      somewhat the manner of a visiting royalty, demanding much attention and
      assistance with his impedimenta. Undoubtedly he liked to be looked at.
      This was what one rather felt. And I can fancy that this very human trait
      of his had in a manner worn upon the probably undisciplined nerves of the
      backwoods josser&mdash;had, in fact, deprived him of his &ldquo;goat,&rdquo; as the
      native people have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be this as it may, we gathered at the dock on the afternoon of the third
      day of our stay to assist at the return. As the native log craft neared
      the dock our host daringly arose to a graceful kneeling posture in the bow
      and saluted us charmingly, the woods person in the stern wielding his
      single oar in gloomy silence. At the moment a most poetic image occurred
      to me&mdash;that he was like a dull grim figure of Fate that fetches us
      low at the moment of our highest seeming. I mean to say, it was a silly
      thought, perhaps, yet I afterward recalled it most vividly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding his creel aloft our host hailed us:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Full to-day, thanks to going where I wished and paying no attention to
      silly guides&rsquo; talk.&rdquo; He beamed upon us in an unquestionably superior
      manner, and again from the moody figure at the stern I intercepted the
      flash of a wink to Cousin Egbert. Then as the frail craft had all but
      touched the dock and our host had half risen, there was a sharp dipping of
      the thing and he was ejected into the chilling waters, where he almost
      instantly sank. There were loud cries of alarm from all, including the
      woodsman himself, who had kept the craft upright, and in these Mr.
      Belknap-Jackson heartily joined the moment his head appeared above the
      surface, calling &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; in the quite loudest of tones, which was
      thoughtless enough, as we were close at hand and could easily have heard
      his ordinary speaking voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woods person now stepped to the dock, and firmly grasping the collar
      of the drowning man hauled him out with but little effort, at the same
      time becoming voluble with apologies and sympathy. The rescued man,
      however, was quite off his head with rage and bluntly berated the fellow
      for having tried to assassinate him. Indeed he put forth rather a torrent
      of execration, but to all of this the fellow merely repeated his crude
      protestations of regret and astonishment, seeming to be sincerely grieved
      that his intentions should have been doubted.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his friends about him the unfortunate man was receiving the most
      urgent advice to seek dry garments lest he perish of chill, whereupon he
      turned abruptly to me and cried: &ldquo;Well, Stupid, don&rsquo;t you see the state
      that fellow has put me in? What are you doing? Have you lost your wits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now I had suffered a very proper alarm and solicitude for him, but the
      injustice of this got a bit on me. I mean to say, I suddenly felt a bit of
      temper myself, though to be sure retaining my control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; quite so, sir,&rdquo; I replied smoothly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you right as
      rain in no time at all, sir,&rdquo; and started to conduct him off the dock. But
      now, having gone a little distance, he began to utter the most violent
      threats against the woods person, declaring, in fact, he would pull the
      fellow&rsquo;s nose. However, I restrained him from rushing back, as I subtly
      felt I was wished to do, and he at length consented again to be led toward
      his hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the woods person called out: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re forgetting all your
      pretties!&rdquo; By which I saw him to mean the fishing impedimenta he had
      placed on the dock. And most unreasonably at this Mr. Belknap-Jackson
      again turned upon me, wishing anew to be told if I had lost my wits and
      directing me to fetch the stuff. Again I was conscious of that within me
      which no gentleman&rsquo;s man should confess to. I mean to say, I felt like
      shaking him. But I hastened back to fetch the rod, the creel, the luncheon
      hamper, the midge ointment, the camera, and other articles which the woods
      fellow handed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these somewhat awkwardly carried, I returned to our still turbulent
      host. More like a volcano he was than a man who has had a narrow squeak
      from drowning, and before we had gone a dozen feet more he again turned
      and declared he would &ldquo;go back and thrash the unspeakable cad within an
      inch of his life.&rdquo; Their relative sizes rendering an attempt of this sort
      quite too unwise, I was conscious of renewed irritation toward him;
      indeed, the vulgar words, &ldquo;Oh, stow that piffle!&rdquo; swiftly formed in the
      back of my mind, but again I controlled myself, as the chap was now
      sneezing violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Best hurry on, sir,&rdquo; I said with exemplary tact. &ldquo;One might contract a
      severe head-cold from such a wetting,&rdquo; and further endeavoured to sooth
      him while I started ahead to lead him away from the fellow. Then there
      happened that which fulfilled my direst premonitions. Looking back from a
      moment of calm, the psychology of the crisis is of a rudimentary
      simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enraged beyond measure at the woods person, Mr. Belknap-Jackson yet
      retained a fine native caution which counselled him to attempt no violence
      upon that offender; but his mental tension was such that it could be
      relieved only by his attacking some one; preferably some one forbidden to
      retaliate. I walked there temptingly but a pace ahead of him, after my
      well-meant word of advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I make no defence of my own course. I am aware there can be none. I can
      only plead that I had already been vexed not a little by his unjust
      accusations of stupidity, and dismiss with as few words as possible an
      incident that will ever seem to me quite too indecently criminal. Briefly,
      then, with my well-intended &ldquo;Best not lower yourself, sir,&rdquo; Mr.
      Belknap-Jackson forgot himself and I forgot myself. It will be recalled
      that I was in front of him, but I turned rather quickly. (His belongings I
      had carried were widely disseminated.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly there were wild outcries from the others, who had started toward
      the main, or living house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s killed Charles!&rdquo; I heard Mrs. Belknap-Jackson scream; then came the
      deep-chested rumble of the Mixer, &ldquo;Jackson kicked him first!&rdquo; They ran for
      us. They had reached us while our host was down, even while my fist was
      still clenched. Now again the unfortunate man cried &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; as his wife
      assisted him to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send for an officer!&rdquo; cried she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s an anarchist!&rdquo; shouted her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; boomed the Mixer. &ldquo;Jackson got what he was looking for. Do it
      myself if he kicked me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Maw! Oh, Mater!&rdquo; cried her daughter tearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee! He done it in one punch!&rdquo; I heard Cousin Egbert say with what I was
      aghast to suspect was admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Effie, trembling, could but glare at me and gasp. Mercifully she was
      beyond speech for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Belknap-Jackson was now painfully rubbing his right eye, which was not
      what he should have done, and I said as much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, sir, but one does better with a bit of raw beef.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you, you great hulking brute!&rdquo; cried his wife, and made as if to
      shield her husband from another attack from me, which I submit was unjust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bill&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert casually. &ldquo;Put a piece of raw steak on
      it. Gee! with one wallop!&rdquo; And then, quite strangely, for a moment we all
      amiably discussed whether cold compresses might not be better. Presently
      our host was led off by his wife. Mrs. Effie followed them, moaning: &ldquo;Oh,
      oh, oh!&rdquo; in the keenest distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this I took to my own room in dire confusion, making no doubt I would
      presently be given in charge and left to languish in gaol, perhaps given
      six months&rsquo; hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert came to me in a little while and laughed heartily at my fear
      that anything legal would be done. He also made some ill-timed compliments
      on the neatness of the blow I had dealt Mr. Belknap-Jackson, but these I
      found in wretched taste and was begging him to desist, when the Mixer
      entered and began to speak much in the same strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever dare do a thing like that again,&rdquo; she warned me, &ldquo;unless I
      got a ringside seat,&rdquo; to which I remained severely silent, for I felt my
      offence should not be made light of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three rousing cheers!&rdquo; exclaimed Cousin Egbert, whereat the two most
      unfeelingly went through a vivid pantomime of cheering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our host, I understood, had his dinner in bed that night, and throughout
      the evening, as I sat solitary in remorse, came the mocking strains of
      another of their American folksongs with the refrain:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;You made me what I am to-day,
    I hope you&rsquo;re satisfied!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I conceived it to be the Mixer and Cousin Egbert who did this and,
      considering the plight of our host, I thought it in the worst possible
      taste. I had raised my hand against the one American I had met who was at
      all times vogue. And not only this: For I now recalled a certain phrase I
      had flung out as I stood over him, ranting indeed no better than an
      anarchist, a phrase which showed my poor culture to be the flimsiest
      veneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the night, as I lay looking back on the frightful scene, I
      recalled with wonder a swift picture of Cousin Egbert caught as I once
      looked back to the dock. He had most amazingly shaken the woods person by
      the hand, quickly but with marked cordiality. And yet I am quite certain
      he had never been presented to the fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Promptly the next morning came the dreaded summons to meet Mrs. Effie. I
      was of course prepared to accept instant dismissal without a character, if
      indeed I were not to be given in charge. I found her wearing an expression
      of the utmost sternness, erect and formidable by the now silent
      phonograph. Cousin Egbert, who was present, also wore an expression of
      sternness, though I perceived him to wink at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re to do with you, Ruggles,&rdquo; began the
      stricken woman, and so done out she plainly was that I at once felt the
      warmest sympathy for her as she continued: &ldquo;First you lead poor Cousin
      Egbert into a drunken debauch&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert here coughed nervously and eyed me with strong condemnation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;then you behave like a murderer. What have you to say for
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this I saw there was little I could say, except that I had coarsely
      given way to the brute in me, and yet I knew I should try to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say, Madam, it may have been because Mr. Belknap-Jackson was quite
      sober at the unfortunate moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course Charles was sober. The idea! What of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was remembering an occasion at Chaynes-Wotten when Lord Ivor Cradleigh
      behaved toward me somewhat as Mr. Belknap-Jackson did last night and when
      my own deportment was quite all that could be wished. It occurs to me now
      that it was because his lordship was, how shall I say?&mdash;quite far
      gone in liquor at the time, so that I could without loss of dignity pass
      it off as a mere prank. Indeed, he regarded it as such himself, performing
      the act with a good nature that I found quite irresistible, and I am
      certain that neither his lordship nor I have ever thought the less of each
      other because of it. I revert to this merely to show that I have not
      always acted in a ruffianly manner under these circumstances. It seems
      rather to depend upon how the thing is done&mdash;the mood of the
      performer&mdash;his mental state. Had Mr. Belknap-Jackson been&mdash;pardon
      me&mdash;quite drunk, I feel that the outcome would have been happier for
      us all. So far as I have thought along these lines, it seems to me that if
      one is to be kicked at all, one must be kicked good-naturedly. I mean to
      say, with a certain camaraderie, a lightness, a gayety, a genuine
      good-will that for the moment expresses itself uncouthly&mdash;an element,
      I regret to say, that was conspicuously lacking from the brief activities
      of Mr. Belknap-Jackson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard such crazy talk,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Effie, &ldquo;and really I never
      saw such a man as you are for wanting people to become disgustingly drunk.
      You made poor Cousin Egbert and Jeff Tuttle act like beasts, and now
      nothing will satisfy you but that Charles should roll in the gutter. Such
      dissipated talk I never did hear, and poor Charles rarely taking anything
      but a single glass of wine, it upsets him so; even our reception punch he
      finds too stimulating!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I mean to say, the woman had cleanly missed my point, for never have I
      advocated the use of fermented liquors to excess; but I saw it was no good
      trying to tell her this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the worst of it,&rdquo; she went rapidly on, &ldquo;Cousin Egbert here is acting
      stranger than I ever knew him to act. He swears if he can&rsquo;t keep you he&rsquo;ll
      never have another man, and you know yourself what that means in his case&mdash;and
      Mrs. Pettengill saying she means to employ you herself if we let you go.
      Heaven knows what the poor woman can be thinking of! Oh, it&rsquo;s awful&mdash;and
      everything was going so beautifully. Of course Charles would simply never
      be brought to accept an apology&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only too anxious to make one,&rdquo; I submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the poor fellow now,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert almost gleefully, and our
      host entered. He carried a patch over his right eye and was not attired
      for sport on the lake, but in a dark morning suit of quietly beautiful
      lines that I thought showed a fine sense of the situation. He shot me one
      superior glance from his left eye and turned to Mrs. Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you still harbour the ruffian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just given him a call-down,&rdquo; said Mrs. Effie, plainly ill at ease,
      &ldquo;and he says it was all because you were sober; that if you&rsquo;d been in the
      state Lord Ivor Cradleigh was the time it happened at Chaynes-Wotten he
      wouldn&rsquo;t have done anything to you, probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, what&rsquo;s this? Lord Ivor Cradleigh&mdash;Chaynes-Wotten?&rdquo; The
      man seemed to be curiously interested by the mere names, in spite of
      himself. &ldquo;His lordship was at Chaynes-Wotten for the shooting, I suppose?&rdquo;
       This, most amazingly, to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A house party at Whitsuntide, sir,&rdquo; I explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! And you say his lordship was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite, quite in his cups, sir. If I might explain, it was that, sir&mdash;its
      being done under circumstances and in a certain entirely genial spirit of
      irritation to which I could take no offence, sir. His lordship is a very
      decent sort, sir. I&rsquo;ve known him intimately for years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Too bad, too bad! And I dare say you thought me
      out of temper last night? Nothing of the sort. You should have taken it in
      quite the same spirit as you did from Lord Ivor Cradleigh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed different, sir,&rdquo; I said firmly. &ldquo;If I may take the liberty of
      putting it so, I felt quite offended by your manner. I missed from it at
      the most critical moment, as one might say, a certain urbanity that I
      found in his lordship, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well! It&rsquo;s too bad, really. I&rsquo;m quite aware that I show a
      sort of brusqueness at times, but mind you, it&rsquo;s all on the surface. Had
      you known me as long as you&rsquo;ve known his lordship, I dare say you&rsquo;d have
      noticed the same rough urbanity in me as well. I rather fancy some of us
      over here don&rsquo;t do those things so very differently. A few of us, at
      least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, indeed, to hear it, sir. It&rsquo;s only necessary to understand that
      there is a certain mood in which one really cannot permit one&rsquo;s self to be&mdash;you
      perceive, I trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, perfectly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I can only express my regret that
      you should have mistaken my own mood, which, I am confident, was exactly
      the thing his lordship might have felt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gladly accept your apology, sir,&rdquo; I returned quickly, &ldquo;as I should have
      accepted his lordship&rsquo;s had his manner permitted any misapprehension on my
      part. And in return I wish to apologize most contritely for the phrase I
      applied to you just after it happened, sir. I rarely use strong language,
      but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember hearing none,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret to say, sir, that I called you a blighted little mug&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t have mentioned it,&rdquo; he replied with just a trace of
      sharpness, &ldquo;and I trust that in future&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure, sir, that in future you will give me no occasion to
      misunderstand your intentions&mdash;no more than would his lordship,&rdquo; I
      added as he raised his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus in a manner wholly unexpected was a frightful situation eased off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad it&rsquo;s settled!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Effie, who had listened almost
      breathlessly to our exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy I settled it as Cradleigh would have&mdash;eh, Ruggles?&rdquo; And the
      man actually smiled at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entirely so, sir,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only it doesn&rsquo;t get out,&rdquo; said Mrs. Effie now. &ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t want it
      known in Red Gap. Think of the talk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Belknap-Jackson jauntily, &ldquo;we are all here above
      gossip about an affair of that sort. I am sure&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off and
      looked uneasily at Cousin Egbert, who coughed into his hand and looked out
      over the lake before he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would I want to tell a thing like that for?&rdquo; he demanded
      indignantly, as if an accusation had been made against him. But I saw his
      eyes glitter with an evil light.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later I chanced to be with him in our detached hut, when the Mixer
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you reckon happened?&rdquo; returned Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;They get to
      talking about Lord Ivy Craddles, or some guy, and before we know it Mr.
      Belknap Hyphen Jackson is apologizing to Bill here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; bellowed the Mixer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure did he!&rdquo; affirmed Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they grasped each other&rsquo;s arms and did a rude native dance about the
      room, nor did they desist when I sought to explain that the name was not
      at all Ivy Craddles.

      CHAPTER SEVEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now once more it seemed that for a time I might lead a sanely ordered
      existence. Not for long did I hope it. I think I had become resigned to
      the unending series of shocks that seemed to compose the daily life in
      North America. Few had been my peaceful hours since that fatal evening in
      Paris. And the shocks had become increasingly violent. When I tried to
      picture what the next might be I found myself shuddering. For the present,
      like a stag that has eluded the hounds but hears their distant baying, I
      lay panting in momentary security, gathering breath for some new course. I
      mean to say, one couldn&rsquo;t tell what might happen next. Again and again I
      found myself coming all over frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wholly restored I was now in the esteem of Mr. Belknap-Jackson, who never
      tired of discussing with me our own life and people. Indeed he was quite
      the most intelligent foreigner I had encountered. I may seem to exaggerate
      in the American fashion, but I doubt if a single one of the others could
      have named the counties of England or the present Lord Mayor of London.
      Our host was not like that. Also he early gave me to know that he felt
      quite as we do concerning the rebellion of our American colonies, holding
      it a matter for the deepest regret; and justly proud he was of the
      circumstance that at the time of that rebellion his own family had put all
      possible obstacles in the way of the traitorous Washington. To be sure, I
      dare say he may have boasted a bit in this.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during the long journey across America which we now set out upon
      that I came to this sympathetic understanding of his character and of the
      chagrin he constantly felt at being compelled to live among people with
      whom he could have as little sympathy as I myself had.
    </p>
    <p>
      This journey began pleasantly enough, and through the farming counties of
      Philadelphia, Ohio, and Chicago was not without interest. Beyond came an
      incredibly large region, much like the steppes of Siberia, I fancy: vast
      uninhabited stretches of heath and down, with but here and there some rude
      settlement about which the poor peasants would eagerly assemble as our
      train passed through. I could not wonder that our own travellers have
      always spoken so disparagingly of the American civilization. It is a
      country that would never do with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although we lived in this train a matter of nearly four days, I fancy not
      a single person dressed for dinner as one would on shipboard. Even
      Belknap-Jackson dined in a lounge-suit, though he wore gloves constantly
      by day, which was more than I could get Cousin Egbert to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we went ever farther over these leagues of fen and fell and rolling
      veldt, I could but speculate unquietly as to what sort of place the Red
      Gap must be. A residential town for gentlemen and families, I had
      understood, with a little colony of people that really mattered, as I had
      gathered from Mrs. Effie. And yet I was unable to divine their object in
      going so far away to live. One goes to distant places for the winter
      sports or for big game shooting, but this seemed rather grotesquely
      perverse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little did I then dream of the spiritual agencies that were to insure my
      gradual understanding of the town and its people. Unsuspectingly I fronted
      a future so wildly improbable that no power could have made me credit it
      had it then been foretold by the most rarely endowed gypsy. It is always
      now with a sort of terror that I look back to those last moments before my
      destiny had unfolded far enough to be actually alarming. I was as one
      floating in fancied security down the calm river above their famous
      Niagara Falls&mdash;to be presently dashed without warning over the
      horrible verge. I mean to say, I never suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our last day of travel arrived. We were now in a roughened and most untidy
      welter of mountain and jungle and glen, with violent tarns and bleak bits
      of moorland that had all too evidently never known the calming touch of
      the landscape gardener; a region, moreover, peopled by a much more lawless
      appearing peasantry than I had observed back in the Chicago counties,
      people for the most part quite wretchedly gotten up and distinctly of the
      lower or working classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon our train wound out of a narrow cutting and into a
      valley that broadened away on every hand to distant mountains. Beyond
      doubt this prospect could, in a loose way of speaking, be called scenery,
      but of too violent a character it was for cultivated tastes. Then, as my
      eye caught the vague outlines of a settlement or village in the midst of
      this valley, Cousin Egbert, who also looked from, the coach window, amazed
      me by crying out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she is&mdash;little old Red Gap! The fastest growing town in the
      State, if any one should ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I&rsquo;ll try to remember, sir,&rdquo; I said, wondering why I should be
      asked this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Garden spot of the world,&rdquo; he added in a kind of ecstasy, to which I made
      no response, for this was too preposterous. Nearing the place our train
      passed an immense hoarding erected by the roadway, a score of feet high, I
      should say, and at least a dozen times as long, upon which was emblazoned
      in mammoth red letters on a black ground, &ldquo;<i>Keep Your Eye on Red Gap!</i>&rdquo;
       At either end of this lettering was painted a gigantic staring human eye.
      Regarding this monstrosity with startled interest, I heard myself
      addressed by Belknap-Jackson:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sort of vulgarity I&rsquo;m obliged to contend with,&rdquo; said he, with a
      contemptuous gesture toward the hoarding. Indeed the thing lacked
      refinement in its diction, while the painted eyes were not Art in any true
      sense of the word. &ldquo;The work of our precious Chamber of Commerce,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;though I pleaded with them for days and days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sort of thing would never do with us, sir,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what one has to expect from a commercialized bourgeoise,&rdquo; he
      returned bitterly. &ldquo;And even our association, &lsquo;The City Beautiful,&rsquo; of
      which I was president, helped to erect the thing. Of course I resigned at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally, sir; the colours are atrocious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the words a mere blatant boast!&rdquo; He groaned and left me, for we were
      now well into a suburb of detached villas, many of them of a squalid
      character, and presently we had halted at the station. About this bleak
      affair was the usual gathering of peasantry and the common people,
      villagers, agricultural labourers, and the like, and these at once showed
      a tremendous interest in our party, many of them hailing various members
      of us with a quite offensive familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belknap-Jackson, of course, bore himself through this with a proper
      aloofness, as did his wife and Mrs. Effie, but I heard the Mixer booming
      salutations right and left. It was Cousin Egbert, however, who most
      embarrassed me by the freedom of his manner with these persons. He shook
      hands warmly with at least a dozen of them and these hailed him with rude
      shouts, dealt him smart blows on the back and, forming a circle about him,
      escorted him to a carriage where Mrs. Effie and I awaited him. Here the
      driver, a loutish and familiar youth, also seized his hand and, with some
      crude effect of oratory, shouted to the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Sour-dough?&rdquo; To this, with a flourish of their
      impossible hats, they quickly responded in unison,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; accenting the first word terrifically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, to the immense relief of Mrs. Effie and myself, he was released and
      we were driven quickly off from the raffish set. Through their Regent and
      Bond streets we went, though I mean to say they were on an unbelievably
      small or village scale, to an outlying region of detached villas that
      doubtless would be their St. John&rsquo;s Wood, but my efforts to observe
      closely were distracted by the extraordinary freedom with which our driver
      essayed to chat with us, saying he &ldquo;guessed&rdquo; we were glad to get back to
      God&rsquo;s country, and things of a similar intimate nature. This was even more
      embarrassing to Mrs. Effie than it was to me, since she more than once
      felt obliged to answer the fellow with a feigned cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relieved I was when we drew up before the town house of the Flouds. Set
      well back from the driveway in a faded stretch of common, it was of rather
      a garbled architecture, with the Tudor, late Gothic, and French
      Renaissance so intermixed that one was puzzled to separate the periods.
      Nor was the result so vast as this might sound. Hardly would the thing
      have made a wing of the manor house at Chaynes-Wotten. The common or small
      park before it was shielded from the main thoroughfare by a fence of iron
      palings, and back of this on either side of a gravelled walk that led to
      the main entrance were two life-sized stags not badly sculptured from
      metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once inside I began to suspect that my position was going to be more than
      a bit dicky. I mean to say, it was not an establishment in our sense of
      the word, being staffed, apparently, by two China persons who performed
      the functions of cook, housemaids, footmen, butler, and housekeeper. There
      was not even a billiard room.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the ensuing hour, marked by the arrival of our luggage and the
      unpacking of boxes, I meditated profoundly over the difficulties of my
      situation. In a wilderness, beyond the confines of civilization, I would
      undoubtedly be compelled to endure the hardships of the pioneer; yet for
      the present I resolved to let no inkling of my dismay escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening meal over&mdash;dinner in but the barest technical sense&mdash;I
      sat alone in my own room, meditating thus darkly. Nor was I at all cheered
      by the voice of Cousin Egbert, who sang in his own room adjoining. I had
      found this to be a habit of his, and his songs are always dolorous to the
      last degree. Now, for example, while life seemed all too black to me, he
      sang a favourite of his, the pathetic ballad of two small children
      evidently begging in a business thoroughfare:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Lone and weary through the streets we wander,
      For we have no place to lay our head;
    Not a friend is left on earth to shelter us,
      For both our parents now are dead.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It was a fair crumpler in my then mood. It made me wish to be out of North
      America&mdash;made me long for London; London with a yellow fog and its
      greasy pavements, where one knew what to apprehend. I wanted him to stop,
      but still he atrociously sang in his high, cracked voice:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Dear mother died when we were both young,
      And father built for us a home,
    But now he&rsquo;s killed by falling timbers,
      And we are left here all alone.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I dare say I should have rushed madly into the night had there been
      another verse, but now he was still. A moment later, however, he entered
      my room with the suggestion that I stroll about the village streets with
      him, he having a mission to perform for Mrs. Effie. I had already heard
      her confide this to him. He was to proceed to the office of their
      newspaper and there leave with the press chap a notice of our arrival
      which from day to day she had been composing on the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just got to leave this here piece for the <i>Recorder</i>,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;then we can sasshay up and down for a while and meet some of the boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How profoundly may our whole destiny be affected by the mood of an idle
      moment; by some superficial indecision, mere fruit of a transient unrest.
      We lightly debate, we hesitate, we yawn, unconscious of the brink. We
      half-heartedly decline a suggested course, then lightly accept from sheer
      ennui, and &ldquo;life,&rdquo; as I have read in a quite meritorious poem, &ldquo;is never
      the same again.&rdquo; It was thus I now toyed there with my fate in my hands,
      as might a child have toyed with a bauble. I mean to say, I was looking
      for nothing thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s wrote a very fancy piece for that newspaper,&rdquo; Cousin Egbert went
      on, handing me the sheets of manuscript. Idly I glanced down the pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday saw the return to Red Gap of Mrs. Senator James Knox Floud and
      Egbert G. Floud from their extensive European tour,&rdquo; it began. Farther I
      caught vagrant lines, salient phrases: &ldquo;&mdash;the well-known social
      leader of our North Side set ... planning a series of entertainments for
      the approaching social season that promise to eclipse all previous
      gayeties of Red Gap&rsquo;s smart set ... holding the reins of social leadership
      with a firm grasp ... distinguished for her social graces and tact as a
      hostess ... their palatial home on Ophir Avenue, the scene of so much of
      the smart social life that has distinguished our beautiful city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It left me rather unmoved from my depression, even the concluding note:
      &ldquo;The Flouds are accompanied by their English manservant, secured through
      the kind offices of the brother of his lordship Earl of Brinstead, the
      well-known English peer, who will no doubt do much to impart to the coming
      functions that air of smartness which distinguishes the highest social
      circles of London, Paris, and other capitals of the great world of
      fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some mess of words, that,&rdquo; observed Cousin Egbert, and it did indeed seem
      to be rather intimately phrased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better come along with me,&rdquo; he again urged. There was a moment&rsquo;s fateful
      silence, then, quite mechanically, I arose and prepared to accompany him.
      In the hall below I handed him his evening stick and gloves, which he
      absently took from me, and we presently traversed that street of houses
      much in the fashion of the Floud house and nearly all boasting some
      sculptured bit of wild life on their terraces.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a calm night of late summer; all Nature seemed at peace. I looked
      aloft and reflected that the same stars were shining upon the civilization
      I had left so far behind. As we walked I lost myself in musing pensively
      upon this curious astronomical fact and upon the further vicissitudes to
      which I would surely be exposed. I compared myself whimsically to an
      explorer chap who has ventured among a tribe of natives and who must seem
      to adopt their weird manners and customs to save himself from their
      fanatic violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this I was aroused by Cousin Egbert, who, with sudden dismay
      regarding his stick and gloves, uttered a low cry of anguish and thrust
      them into my hands before I had divined his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to tote them there things,&rdquo; he swiftly explained. &ldquo;I forgot
      where I was.&rdquo; I demurred sharply, but he would not listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mind it so much in Paris and Europe, where I ain&rsquo;t so very well
      known, but my good gosh! man, this is my home town. You&rsquo;ll have to take
      them. People won&rsquo;t notice it in you so much, you being a foreigner,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without further objection I wearily took them, finding a desperate
      drollery in being regarded as a foreigner, whereas I was simply alone
      among foreigners; but I knew that Cousin Egbert lacked the subtlety to
      grasp this point of view and made no effort to lay it before him. It was
      clear to me then, I think, that he would forever remain socially
      impossible, though perhaps no bad sort from a mere human point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      We continued our stroll, turning presently from this residential avenue to
      a street of small unlighted shops, and from this into a wider and
      brilliantly lighted thoroughfare of larger shops, where my companion
      presently began to greet native acquaintances. And now once more he
      affected that fashion of presenting me to his friends that I had so
      deplored in Paris. His own greeting made, he would call out heartily:
      &ldquo;Shake hands with my friend Colonel Ruggles!&rdquo; Nor would he heed my
      protests at this, so that in sheer desperation I presently ceased making
      them, reflecting that after all we were encountering the street classes of
      the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a score of such casual meetings I was thus presented, for he seemed to
      know quite almost every one and at times there would be a group of natives
      about us on the pavement. Twice we went into &ldquo;saloons,&rdquo; as they rather
      pretentiously style their public houses, where Cousin Egbert would stand
      the drinks for all present, not omitting each time to present me formally
      to the bar-man. In all these instances I was at once asked what I thought
      of their town, which was at first rather embarrassing, as I was confident
      that any frank disclosure of my opinion, being necessarily hurried, might
      easily be misunderstood. I at length devised a conventional formula of
      praise which, although feeling a frightful fool, I delivered each time
      thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we progressed the length of their commercial centre, the incidents
      varying but little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Sour-dough, you old shellback! When did you come off the trail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just got in. My lands! but it&rsquo;s good to be back. Billy, shake hands with
      my friend Colonel Ruggles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I mean to say, the persons were not all named &ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; that being used
      only by way of illustration. Sometimes they would be called &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;Hank&rdquo; or &ldquo;Al&rdquo; or &ldquo;Chris.&rdquo; Nor was my companion invariably called &ldquo;shellback.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Horned-toad&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stinging-lizard&rdquo; were also epithets much in favour with
      his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of this street we at length paused before the office, as I saw,
      of &ldquo;The Red Gap <i>Recorder</i>; Daily and Weekly.&rdquo; Cousin Egbert entered
      here, but came out almost at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henshaw ain&rsquo;t there, and she said I got to be sure and give him this here
      piece personally; so come on. He&rsquo;s up to a lawn-feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A social function, sir?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; just a lawn-feet up in Judge Ballard&rsquo;s front yard to raise money for
      new uniforms for the band&mdash;that&rsquo;s what the boy said in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But would it not be highly improper for me to appear there, sir?&rdquo; I at
      once objected. &ldquo;I fear it&rsquo;s not done, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk foolish that way. You&rsquo;re a peach of a
      little mixer all right. Come on! Everybody goes. They&rsquo;ll even let me in. I
      can give this here piece to Henshaw and then we&rsquo;ll spend a little money to
      help the band-boys along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My misgivings were by no means dispelled, yet as the affair seemed to be
      public rather than smart, I allowed myself to be led on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into another street of residences we turned, and after a brisk walk I was
      able to identify the &ldquo;front yard&rdquo; of which my companion had spoken. The
      strains of an orchestra came to us and from the trees and shrubbery
      gleamed the lights of paper lanterns. I could discern tents and marquees,
      a throng of people moving among them. Nearer, I observed a refreshment
      pavilion and a dancing platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the gate, Cousin Egbert paid for us an entrance fee of two
      shillings to a young lady in gypsy costume whom he greeted cordially as
      Beryl Mae, not omitting to present me to her as Colonel Ruggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      We moved into the thick of the crowd. There was much laughter and hearty
      speech, and it at once occurred to me that Cousin Egbert had been right:
      it would not be an assemblage of people that mattered, but rather of small
      tradesmen, artisans, tenant-farmers and the like with whom I could
      properly mingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      My companion was greeted by several of the throng, to whom he in turn
      presented me, among them after a bit to a slight, reddish-bearded person
      wearing thick nose-glasses whom I understood to be the pressman we were in
      search of. Nervous of manner he was and preoccupied with a notebook in
      which he frantically scribbled items from time to time. Yet no sooner was
      I presented to him than he began a quizzing sort of conversation with me
      that lasted near a half-hour, I should say. Very interested he seemed to
      hear of my previous life, having in full measure that naïve curiosity
      about one which Americans take so little pains to hide. Like the other
      natives I had met that evening, he was especially concerned to know what I
      thought of Red Gap. The chat was not at all unpleasant, as he seemed to be
      a well-informed person, and it was not without regret that I noted the
      approach of Cousin Egbert in company with a pleasant-faced, middle-aged
      lady in Oriental garb, carrying a tambourine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Ballard, allow me to make you acquainted with my friend Colonel
      Ruggles!&rdquo; Thus Cousin Egbert performed his ceremony. The lady grasped my
      hand with great cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You men have monopolized the Colonel long enough,&rdquo; she began with a large
      coquetry that I found not unpleasing, and firmly grasping my arm she led
      me off in the direction of the refreshment pavilion, where I was playfully
      let to know that I should purchase her bits of refreshment, coffee,
      plum-cake, an ice, things of that sort. Through it all she kept up a
      running fire of banter, from time to time presenting me to other women
      young and old who happened about us, all of whom betrayed an interest in
      my personality that was not unflattering, even from this commoner sort of
      the town&rsquo;s people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor would my new friend release me when she had refreshed herself, but had
      it that I must dance with her. I had now to confess that I was unskilled
      in the native American folk dances which I had observed being performed,
      whereupon she briskly chided me for my backwardness, but commanded a valse
      from the musicians, and this we danced together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may here say that I am not without a certain finesse on the
      dancing-floor and I rather enjoyed the momentary abandon with this village
      worthy. Indeed I had rather enjoyed the whole affair, though I felt that
      my manner was gradually marking me as one apart from the natives; made
      conscious I was of a more finished, a suaver formality in myself&mdash;the
      Mrs. Ballard I had met came at length to be by way of tapping me
      coquettishly with her tambourine in our lighter moments. Also my presence
      increasingly drew attention, more and more of the village belles and
      matrons demanding in their hearty way to be presented to me. Indeed the
      society was vastly more enlivening, I reflected, than I had found it in a
      similar walk of life at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather regretfully I left with Cousin Egbert, who found me at last in one
      of the tents having my palm read by the gypsy young person who had taken
      our fees at the gate. Of course I am aware that she was probably without
      any real gifts for this science, as so few are who undertake it at charity
      bazaars, yet she told me not a few things that were significant: that my
      somewhat cold exterior and air of sternness were but a mask to shield a
      too-impulsive nature; that I possessed great firmness of character and was
      fond of Nature. She added peculiarly at the last &ldquo;I see trouble ahead, but
      you are not to be downcast&mdash;the skies will brighten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point that Cousin Egbert found me, and after he had warned
      the young woman that I was &ldquo;some mixer&rdquo; we departed. Not until we had
      reached the Floud home did he discover that he had quite forgotten to hand
      the press-chap Mrs. Effie&rsquo;s manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dog on the luck!&rdquo; said he in his quaint tone of exasperation, &ldquo;here I&rsquo;ve
      went and forgot to give Mrs. Effie&rsquo;s piece to the editor.&rdquo; He sighed
      ruefully. &ldquo;Well, to-morrow&rsquo;s another day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so the die was cast. To-morrow was indeed another day!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I fell asleep on a memory of the evening that brought me a sort of
      shamed pleasure&mdash;that I had falsely borne the stick and gloves of
      Cousin Egbert. I knew they had given me rather an air.

      CHAPTER EIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have never been able to recall the precise moment the next morning when
      I began to feel a strange disquietude but the opening hours of the day
      were marked by a series of occurrences slight in themselves yet so
      cumulatively ominous that they seemed to lower above me like a cloud of
      menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking from my window, shortly after the rising hour, I observed a paper
      boy pass through the street, whistling a popular melody as he ran up to
      toss folded journals into doorways. Something I cannot explain went
      through me even then; some premonition of disaster slinking furtively
      under my casual reflection that even in this remote wild the public press
      was not unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later the telephone rang in a lower room and I heard Mrs.
      Effie speak in answer. An unusual note in her voice caused me to listen
      more attentively. I stepped outside my door. To some one she was
      expressing amazement, doubt, and quick impatience which seemed to
      culminate, after she had again, listened, in a piercing cry of
      consternation. The term is not too strong. Evidently by the unknown
      speaker she had been first puzzled, then startled, then horrified; and
      now, as her anguished cry still rang in my ears, that snaky premonition of
      evil again writhed across my consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently I heard the front door open and close. Peering into the hallway
      below I saw that she had secured the newspaper I had seen dropped. Her own
      door now closed upon her. I waited, listening intently. Something told me
      that the incident was not closed. A brief interval elapsed and she was
      again at the telephone, excitedly demanding to be put through to a number.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come at once!&rdquo; I heard her cry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unspeakable! There isn&rsquo;t a moment
      to lose! Come as you are!&rdquo; Hereupon, banging the receiver into its place
      with frenzied roughness, she ran halfway up the stairs to shout:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egbert Floud! Egbert Floud! You march right down here this minute, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From his room I heard an alarmed response, and a moment later knew that he
      had joined her. The door closed upon them, but high words reached me.
      Mostly the words of Mrs. Effie they were, though I could detect muffled
      retorts from the other. Wondering what this could portend, I noted from my
      window some ten minutes later the hurried arrival of the C.
      Belknap-Jacksons. The husband clenched a crumpled newspaper in one hand
      and both he and his wife betrayed signs to the trained eye of having
      performed hasty toilets for this early call.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door of the drawing-room closed upon them there ensued a terrific
      outburst carrying a rich general effect of astounded rage. Some moments
      the sinister chorus continued, then a door sharply opened and I heard my
      own name cried out by Mrs. Effie in a tone that caused me to shudder.
      Rapidly descending the stairs, I entered the room to face the excited
      group. Cousin Egbert crouched on a sofa in a far corner like a hunted
      beast, but the others were standing, and all glared at me furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies addressed me simultaneously, one of them, I believe, asking me
      what I meant by it and the other demanding how dared I, which had the sole
      effect of adding to my bewilderment, nor did the words of Cousin Egbert
      diminish this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Bill!&rdquo; he called, adding with a sort of timid bravado: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      let &lsquo;em bluff you, not for a minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and it was probably all that wretched Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s fault in the
      first place,&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Belknap-Jackson almost tearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, listen here, now; I don&rsquo;t see as how I&rsquo;ve done anything wrong,&rdquo; he
      feebly protested. &ldquo;Bill&rsquo;s human, ain&rsquo;t he? Answer me that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One sees it all!&rdquo; This from Belknap-Jackson in bitter and judicial tones.
      He flung out his hands at Cousin Egbert in a gesture of pitiless scorn. &ldquo;I
      dare say,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that poor Ruggles was merely a tool in his hands&mdash;weak,
      possibly, but not vicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I inquire&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I made bold to begin, but Mrs. Effie shut me
      off, brandishing the newspaper before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it!&rdquo; she commanded in hoarse, tragic tones. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she added,
      pointing at monstrous black headlines on the page as I weakly took it from
      her. And then I saw. There before them, divining now the enormity of what
      had come to pass, I controlled myself to master the following screed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    RED GAP&rsquo;S DISTINGUISHED VISITOR

    Colonel Marmaduke Ruggles of London and Paris, late of the
    British army, bon-vivant and man of the world, is in our midst
    for an indefinite stay, being at present the honoured house
    guest of Senator and Mrs. James Knox Floud, who returned from
    foreign parts on the 5:16 flyer yesterday afternoon. Colonel
    Ruggles has long been intimately associated with the family
    of his lordship the Earl of Brinstead, and especially with
    his lordship&rsquo;s brother, the Honourable George Augustus
    Vane-Basingwell, with whom he has recently been sojourning
    in la belle France. In a brief interview which the Colonel
    genially accorded ye scribe, he expressed himself as delighted
    with our thriving little city.

    &ldquo;It&rsquo;s somewhat a town&mdash;if I&rsquo;ve caught your American slang,&rdquo;
     he said with a merry twinkle in his eyes. &ldquo;You have the garden
    spot of the West, if not of the civilized world, and your
    people display a charm that must be, I dare say, typically
    American. Altogether, I am enchanted with the wonders I have
    beheld since landing at your New York, particularly with the
    habit your best people have of roughing it in camps like that
    of Mr. C. Belknap-Jackson among the mountains of New York, where
    I was most pleasantly entertained by himself and his delightful
    wife. The length of my stay among you is uncertain, though I
    have been pressed by the Flouds, with whom I am stopping, and
    by the C. Belknap-Jacksons to prolong it indefinitely, and in
    fact to identify myself to an extent with your social life.&rdquo;
 
    The Colonel is a man of distinguished appearance, with the
    seasoned bearing of an old campaigner, and though at moments
    he displays that cool reserve so typical of the English
    gentleman, evidence was not lacking last evening that he can
    unbend on occasion. At the lawn fête held in the spacious
    grounds of Judge Ballard, where a myriad Japanese lanterns
    made the scene a veritable fairyland, he was quite the most
    sought-after notable present, and gayly tripped the light
    fantastic toe with the élite of Red Gap&rsquo;s smart set there
    assembled.

    From his cordial manner of entering into the spirit of the
    affair we predict that Colonel Ruggles will be a decided
    acquisition to our social life, and we understand that a
    series of recherché entertainments in his honour has already
    been planned by Mrs. County Judge Ballard, who took the
    distinguished guest under her wing the moment he appeared
    last evening. Welcome to our city, Colonel! And may the warm
    hearts of Red Gap cause you to forget that European world of
    fashion of which you have long been so distinguished an
    ornament!
</pre>
    <p>
      In a sickening silence I finished the thing. As the absurd sheet fell from
      my nerveless fingers Mrs. Effie cried in a voice hoarse with emotion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you realize the dreadful thing you&rsquo;ve done to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Speechless I was with humiliation, unequal even to protesting that I had
      said nothing of the sort to the press-chap. I mean to say, he had
      wretchedly twisted my harmless words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you nothing to say for yourself?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Belknap-Jackson,
      also in a voice hoarse with emotion. I glanced at her husband. He, too,
      was pale with anger and trembling, so that I fancied he dared not trust
      himself to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wretched man,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Effie, addressing them all, &ldquo;simply
      can&rsquo;t realize&mdash;how disgraceful it is. Oh, we shall never be able to
      live it down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imagine those flippant Spokane sheets dressing up the thing,&rdquo; hissed
      Belknap-Jackson, speaking for the first time. &ldquo;Imagine their blackguardly
      humour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that awful Cousin Egbert,&rdquo; broke in Mrs. Effie, pointing a desperate
      finger toward him. &ldquo;Think of the laughing-stock he&rsquo;ll become! Why, he&rsquo;ll
      simply never be able to hold up his head again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, you listen here,&rdquo; exclaimed Cousin Egbert with sudden heat; &ldquo;never
      you mind about my head. I always been able to hold up my head any time I
      felt like it.&rdquo; And again to me he threw out, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you let &lsquo;em bluff you,
      Bill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave him a notice for the paper,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Effie plaintively;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d written it all nicely out to save them time in the office, and that
      would have prevented this disgrace, but he never gave it in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I clean forgot it,&rdquo; declared the offender. &ldquo;What with one thing and
      another, and gassing back and forth with some o&rsquo; the boys, it kind of went
      out o&rsquo; my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meeting our best people&mdash;actually dancing with them!&rdquo; murmured Mrs.
      Belknap-Jackson in a voice vibrant with horror. &ldquo;My dear, I truly am so
      sorry for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You people entertained him delightfully at your camp,&rdquo; murmured Mrs.
      Effie quickly in her turn, with a gesture toward the journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re both in it, I know. I know. It&rsquo;s appalling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never be able to live it down!&rdquo; said Mrs. Effie. &ldquo;We shall have to
      go away somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you imagine what Jen&rsquo; Ballard will say when she learns the truth?&rdquo;
       asked the other bitterly. &ldquo;Say we did it on purpose to humiliate her, and
      just as all our little scraps were being smoothed out, so we could get
      together and put that Bohemian set in its place. Oh, it&rsquo;s so dreadful!&rdquo; On
      the verge of tears she seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And scarcely a word mentioned of our own return&mdash;when I&rsquo;d taken such
      pains with the notice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen here!&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert brightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the piece down now
      and he can print it in his paper for you to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she replied impatiently. &ldquo;I casually mentioned our
      having brought an English manservant. Print that now and insult all our
      best people who received him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pathetic how little the poor chap understands,&rdquo; sighed Belknap-Jackson.
      &ldquo;No sense at all of our plight&mdash;naturally, naturally!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A series of entertainments being planned in his honour!&rsquo;&rdquo; quavered Mrs.
      Belknap-Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The most sought-after notable present!&rsquo;&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Effie viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again I had essayed to protest my innocence, only to provoke
      renewed outbursts. I could but stand there with what dignity I retained
      and let them savage me. Cousin Egbert now spoke again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks! What&rsquo;s all the fuss? Just because I took Bill out and give him a
      good time! Didn&rsquo;t you say yourself in that there very piece that he&rsquo;d
      impart to coming functions an air of smartiness like they have all over
      Europe? Didn&rsquo;t you write them very words? And ain&rsquo;t he already done it the
      very first night he gets here, right at that there lawn-feet where I took
      him? What for do you jump on me then? I took him and he done it; he done
      it good. Bill&rsquo;s a born mixer. Why, he had all them North Side society
      dames stung the minute I flashed him; after him quicker than hell could
      scorch a feather; run out from under their hats to get introduced to him&mdash;and
      now you all turn on me like a passel of starved wolves.&rdquo; He finished with
      a note of genuine irritation I had never heard in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor creature&rsquo;s demented,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Belknap-Jackson pityingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always been that way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Effie hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belknap-Jackson contented himself with a mere clicking sound of
      commiseration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then, if you&rsquo;re so smart,&rdquo; continued Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;Just the
      same Bill, here, is the most popular thing in the whole Kulanche Valley
      this minute, so all I got to say is if you want to play this here society
      game you better stick close by him. First thing you know, some o&rsquo; them
      other dames&rsquo;ll have him won from you. That Mis&rsquo; Ballard&rsquo;s going to invite
      him to supper or dinner or some other doings right away. I heard her say
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To my amazement a curious and prolonged silence greeted this amazing
      tirade. The three at length were regarding each other almost furtively.
      Belknap-Jackson began to pace the floor in deep thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, no one knows except ourselves,&rdquo; he said in curiously hushed
      tones at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s one way out of a dreadful mess,&rdquo; observed his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Marmaduke Ruggles of the British army,&rdquo; said Mrs. Effie in a
      peculiar tone, as if she were trying over a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may indeed be the best way out of an impossible situation,&rdquo; continued
      Belknap-Jackson musingly. &ldquo;Otherwise we face a social upheaval that might
      leave us demoralized for years&mdash;say nothing of making us a
      laughingstock with the rabble. In fact, I see nothing else to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin Egbert would be sure to spoil it all again,&rdquo; objected Mrs. Effie,
      glaring at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No danger,&rdquo; returned the other with his superior smile. &ldquo;Being quite
      unable to realize what has happened, he will be equally unable to realize
      what is going to happen. We may speak before him as before a babe in arms;
      the amenities of the situation are forever beyond him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I always been able to hold up my head when I felt like it,&rdquo; put
      in Cousin Egbert, now again both sullen and puzzled. Once more he threw
      out his encouragement to me: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let &lsquo;em run any bluffs, Bill! They
      can&rsquo;t touch you, and they know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Touch him,&rsquo;&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Belknap-Jackson with an able sneer. &ldquo;My dear,
      what a trial he must have been to you. I never knew. He&rsquo;s as bad as the
      mater, actually.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And such hopes I had of him in Paris,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Effie, &ldquo;when he was
      taking up Art and dressing for dinner and everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can be pushed just so far!&rdquo; muttered the offender darkly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was now a ring at the door which I took the liberty of answering,
      and received two notes from a messenger. One bore the address of Mrs.
      Floud and the other was quite astonishingly to myself, the name preceded
      by &ldquo;Colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Jen&rsquo; Ballard&rsquo;s stationery!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Belknap-Jackson. &ldquo;Trust her
      not to lose one second in getting busy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he mustn&rsquo;t answer the door that way,&rdquo; exclaimed her husband as I
      handed Mrs. Effie her note.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were indeed both from my acquaintance of the night before. Receiving
      permission to read my own, I found it to be a dinner invitation for the
      following Friday. Mrs. Effie looked up from hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all too true,&rdquo; she announced grimly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re asked to dinner and she
      earnestly hopes dear Colonel Ruggles will have made no other engagement.
      She also says hasn&rsquo;t he the darlingest English accent. Oh, isn&rsquo;t it a
      mess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see how right I am,&rdquo; said Belknap-Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve got to go through with it,&rdquo; conceded Mrs. Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pushing thing that Ballard woman is!&rdquo; observed her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruggles!&rdquo; exclaimed Belknap-Jackson, addressing me with sudden decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen carefully&mdash;I&rsquo;m quite serious. In future you will try to
      address me as if I were your equal. Ah! rather you will try to address me
      as if you were <i>my</i> equal. I dare say it will come to you easily
      after a bit of practice. Your employers will wish you to address them in
      the same manner. You will cultivate toward us a manner of easy
      friendliness&mdash;remember I&rsquo;m entirely serious&mdash;quite as if you
      were one of us. You must try to be, in short, the Colonel Marmaduke
      Ruggles that wretched penny-a-liner has foisted upon these innocent
      people. We shall thus avert a most humiliating contretemps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thing fair staggered me. I fell weakly into the chair by which I had
      stood, for the first time in a not uneventful career feeling that my <i>savoir
      faire</i> had been overtaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Be seated as one of us,&rdquo; and he amazingly
      proffered me his cigarette case. &ldquo;Do take one, old chap,&rdquo; he insisted as I
      weakly waved it away, and against my will I did so. &ldquo;Dare say you&rsquo;ll fancy
      them&mdash;a non-throat cigarette especially prescribed for me.&rdquo; He now
      held a match so that I was obliged to smoke. Never have I been in less
      humour for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, not so hard, is it? You see, we&rsquo;re getting on famously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I always said Bill was a good mixer?&rdquo; called Cousin Egbert, but his
      gaucherie was pointedly ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Belknap-Jackson, &ldquo;suppose you tell us in a chatty,
      friendly way just what you think about this regrettable affair.&rdquo; All sat
      forward interestedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I met what I supposed were your villagers,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;your small
      tradesmen, your artisans, clerks, shop-assistants, tenant-farmers, and the
      like, I&rsquo;d no idea in the world they were your county families. Seemed
      quite a bit too jolly for that. And your press-chap&mdash;preposterous,
      quite! He quizzed me rather, I admit, but he made it vastly different.
      Your pressmen are remarkable. That thing is a fair crumpler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Effie, &ldquo;you could see that Mrs. Judge Ballard
      must be one of our best people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw she was a goodish sort,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;but it never occurred to me
      one would meet her in your best houses. And when she spoke of entertaining
      me I fancied I might stroll by her cottage some fair day and be asked in
      to a slice from one of her own loaves and a dish of tea. There was that
      about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; exclaimed both ladies, Mrs. Belknap-Jackson adding a bit
      maliciously I thought, &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you awfully wish she could hear him say
      it just that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the title,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;Mr. Egbert has from the first had a
      curious American tendency to present me to his many friends as &lsquo;Colonel.&rsquo; 
      I am sure he means as little by it as when he calls me &lsquo;Bill,&rsquo; which I
      have often reminded him is not a name of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we understand the poor chap is a social incompetent,&rdquo; said
      Belknap-Jackson with a despairing shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, look here,&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Cousin Egbert, a new heat in his
      tone, &ldquo;what I call Bill ain&rsquo;t a marker to what I call you when I really
      get going. You ought to hear me some day when I&rsquo;m feeling right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; exclaimed the other with elaborate sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Surest thing you know. I could call you a lot of good things
      right now if so many ladies wasn&rsquo;t around. You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be afraid,
      do you? Why, Bill there had you licked with one wallop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But really, really!&rdquo; protested the other with a helpless shrug to the
      ladies, who were gasping with dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ruffian!&rdquo; cried his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Egbert Floud,&rdquo; said Mrs. Effie fiercely, &ldquo;you will apologize to Charles
      before you leave this room. The idea of forgetting yourself that way.
      Apologize at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;I apologize like I&rsquo;m made to.&rdquo; But he added
      quickly with even more irritation, &ldquo;only don&rsquo;t you get the idea it&rsquo;s
      because I&rsquo;m afraid of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush, tush!&rdquo; said Belknap-Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I apologize, but it ain&rsquo;t for one minute because I&rsquo;m afraid of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your bare apology is ample; I&rsquo;m bound to accept it,&rdquo; replied the other, a
      bit uneasily I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come right down to it,&rdquo; continued Cousin Egbert, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t afraid of
      hardly any person. I can be pushed just so far.&rdquo; Here he looked
      significantly at Mrs. Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all I&rsquo;ve tried to do for him!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I thought he had
      something in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darn it all, I like to be friendly with my friends,&rdquo; he bluntly
      persisted. &ldquo;I call a man anything that suits me. And I ain&rsquo;t ever
      apologized yet because I was afraid. I want all parties here to get that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more, please. It&rsquo;s quite understood,&rdquo; said Belknap-Jackson
      hastily. The other subsided into low mutterings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust you fully understand the situation, Ruggles&mdash;Colonel
      Ruggles,&rdquo; he continued to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s preposterous, but plain as a pillar-box,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I can only
      regret it as keenly as any right-minded person should. It&rsquo;s not at all
      what I&rsquo;ve been accustomed to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Then I suggest that you accompany me for a drive this
      afternoon. I&rsquo;ll call for you with the trap, say at three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; suggested his wife, &ldquo;it might be as well if Colonel Ruggles
      were to come to us as a guest.&rdquo; She was regarding me with a gaze that was
      frankly speculative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not at all, not at all!&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Effie crisply. &ldquo;Having been
      announced as our house guest&mdash;never do in the world for him to go to
      you so soon. We must be careful in this. Later, perhaps, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Briefly the ladies measured each other with a glance. Could it be, I asked
      myself, that they were sparring for the possession of me?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally he will be asked about everywhere, and there&rsquo;ll be loads of
      entertaining to do in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Effie, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d never think of putting it off
      on to you, dear, when we&rsquo;re wholly to blame for the awful thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so thoughtful of you, dear,&rdquo; replied her friend coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At three, then,&rdquo; said Belknap-Jackson as we arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted,&rdquo; I murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert sourly. &ldquo;He wants to show you off.&rdquo;
       This, I could see, was ignored as a sheer indecency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have to get a reception in quick,&rdquo; said Mrs. Effie, her eyes
      narrowed in calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what all the fuss was about,&rdquo; remarked Cousin Egbert again,
      as if to himself; &ldquo;tearing me to pieces like a passel of wolves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Belknap-Jacksons left hastily, not deigning him a glance. And to do
      the poor soul justice, I believe he did not at all know what the &ldquo;fuss&rdquo;
       had been about. The niceties of the situation were beyond him, dear old
      sort though he had shown himself to be. I knew then I was never again to
      be harsh with him, let him dress as he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he asked, the moment we were alone, &ldquo;you remember that thing you
      called him back there that night&mdash;&lsquo;blighted little mug,&rsquo; was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s best forgotten, sir,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, some way it sounded just the thing to call him. It sounded
      bully. What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So far was his darkened mind from comprehending that I, in a foreign land,
      among a weird people, must now have a go at being a gentleman; and that if
      I fluffed my catch we should all be gossipped to rags!
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone in my room I made a hasty inventory of my wardrobe. Thanks to the
      circumstance that the Honourable George, despite my warning, had for
      several years refused to bant, it was rather well stocked. The evening
      clothes were irreproachable; so were the frock coat and a morning suit. Of
      waistcoats there were a number showing but slight wear. The three
      lounge-suits of tweed, though slightly demoded, would still be vogue in
      this remote spot. For sticks, gloves, cravats, and body-linen I saw that I
      should be compelled to levy on the store I had laid in for Cousin Egbert,
      and I happily discovered that his top-hat set me quite effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also in a casket of trifles that had knocked about in my box I had the
      good fortune to find the monocle that the Honourable George had discarded
      some years before on the ground that it was &ldquo;bally nonsense.&rdquo; I screwed
      the glass into my eye. The effect was tremendous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather a lark I might have thought it but for the false military title.
      That was rank deception, and I have always regarded any sort of wrongdoing
      as detestable. Perhaps if he had introduced me as a mere subaltern in a
      line regiment&mdash;but I was powerless.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the afternoon&rsquo;s drive I chose the smartest of the lounge-suits, a
      Carlsbad hat which Cousin Egbert had bitterly resented for himself, and
      for top-coat a light weight, straight-hanging Chesterfield with velvet
      collar which, although the cut studiously avoids a fitted effect, is yet a
      garment that intrigues the eye when carried with any distinction. So many
      top-coats are but mere wrappings! I had, too, gloves of a delicately
      contrasting tint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether I felt I had turned myself out well, and this I found to be the
      verdict of Mrs. Effie, who engaged me in the hall to say that I was to
      have anything in the way of equipment I liked to ask for. Belknap-Jackson
      also, arriving now in a smart trap to which he drove two cobs tandem, was
      at once impressed and made me compliments upon my tenue. I was aware that
      I appeared not badly beside him. I mean to say, I felt that I was vogue in
      the finest sense of the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Effie waved us a farewell from the doorway, and I was conscious that
      from several houses on either side of the avenue we attracted more than a
      bit of attention. There were doors opened, blinds pushed aside, faces&mdash;that
      sort of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a leisurely pace we progressed through the main thoroughfares. That we
      created a sensation, especially along the commercial streets, where my
      host halted at shops to order goods, cannot be denied. Furore is perhaps
      the word. I mean to say, almost quite every one stared. Rather more like a
      parade it was than I could have wished, but I was again resolved to be a
      dead sportsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those who saluted us from time to time were several of the lesser
      townsmen to whom Cousin Egbert had presented me the evening before, and I
      now perceived that most of these were truly persons I must not know in my
      present station&mdash;hodmen, road-menders, grooms, delivery-chaps, that
      sort. In responding to the often florid salutations of such, I instilled
      into my barely perceptible nod a certain frigidity that I trusted might be
      informing. I mean to say, having now a position to keep up, it would never
      do at all to chatter and pal about loosely as Cousin Egbert did.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had done a fairish number of streets, both of shops and villas, we
      drove out a winding roadway along a tarn to the country club. The house
      was an unpretentious structure of native wood, fronting a couple of tennis
      courts and a golf links, but although it was tea-time, not a soul was
      present. Having unlocked the door, my host suggested refreshment and I
      consented to partake of a glass of sherry and a biscuit. But these, it
      seemed, were not to be had; so over pegs of ginger ale, found in an
      ice-chest, we sat for a time and chatted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find us crude, Ruggles, as I warned you,&rdquo; my host observed.
      &ldquo;Take this deserted clubhouse at this hour. It tells the story. Take again
      the matter of sherry and a biscuit&mdash;so simple! Yet no one ever thinks
      of them, and what you mean by a biscuit is in this wretched hole spoken of
      as a cracker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him for the item, resolving to add it to my list of curious
      Americanisms. Already I had begun a narrative of my adventures in this
      wild land, a thing I had tentatively entitled, &ldquo;Alone in North America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though we have people in abundance of ample means,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you will
      regret to know that we have not achieved a leisured class. Barely once in
      a fortnight will you see this club patronized, after all the pains I took
      in its organization. They simply haven&rsquo;t evolved to the idea yet;
      sometimes I have moments in which I despair of their ever doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As usual he grew depressed when speaking of social Red Gap, so that we did
      not tarry long in the silent place that should have been quite alive with
      people smartly having their tea. As we drove back he touched briefly and
      with all delicacy on our changed relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made me only too glad to consent to it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the sodden
      depravity of that Floud chap. Really he&rsquo;s a menace to the community. I saw
      from the degenerate leer on his face this morning that he will not be able
      to keep silent about that little affair of ours back there. Mark my words,
      he&rsquo;ll talk. And fancy how embarrassing had you continued in the office for
      which you were engaged. Fancy it being known I had been assaulted by a&mdash;you
      see what I mean. But now, let him talk his vilest. What is it? A mere
      disagreement between two gentlemen, generous, hot-tempered chaps, followed
      by mutual apologies. A mere nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was conscious of more than a little irritation at his manner of speaking
      of Cousin Egbert, but this in my new character I could hardly betray.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he set me down at the Floud house, &ldquo;Thanks for the breeze-out,&rdquo; I
      said; then, with an easy wave of the hand and in firm tones, &ldquo;Good day,
      Jackson! See you again, old chap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had nerved myself to it as to an icy tub and was rewarded by a glow such
      as had suffused me that morning in Paris after the shameful proceedings
      with Cousin Egbert and the Indian Tuttle. I mean to say, I felt again that
      wonderful thrill of equality&mdash;quite as if my superiors were not all
      about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the house Mrs. Effie addressed the last of a heap of invitations
      for an early reception&mdash;&ldquo;To meet Colonel Marmaduke Ruggles,&rdquo; they
      read.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER NINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of the following fortnight I find it difficult to write coherently. I
      found myself in a steady whirl of receptions, luncheons, dinners, teas,
      and assemblies of rather a pretentious character, at the greater number of
      which I was obliged to appear as the guest of honour. It began with the
      reception of Mrs. Floud, at which I may be said to have made my first
      formal bow to the smarter element of Red Gap, followed by the dinner of
      the Mrs. Ballard, with whom I had formed acquaintance on that first
      memorable evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was during this time like a babe at blind play with a set of chess men,
      not knowing king from pawn nor one rule of the game. Senator Floud&mdash;who
      was but a member of their provincial assembly, I discovered&mdash;sought
      an early opportunity to felicitate me on my changed estate, though he
      seemed not a little amused by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good work!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know I was afraid our having an English valet
      would put me in bad with the voters this fall. They&rsquo;re already saying I
      wear silk stockings since I&rsquo;ve been abroad. My wife did buy me six pair,
      but I&rsquo;ve never worn any. Shows how people talk, though. And even now
      they&rsquo;ll probably say I&rsquo;m making up to the British army. But it&rsquo;s better
      than having a valet in the house. The plain people would never stand my
      having a valet and I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought this most remarkable, that his constituency should resent his
      having proper house service. American politics were, then, more debased
      than even we of England had dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good work!&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;And say, take out your papers&mdash;become
      one of us. Be a citizen. Nothing better than an American citizen on God&rsquo;s
      green earth. Read the Declaration of Independence. Here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       From a bookcase at his hand he reached me a volume. &ldquo;Read and reflect, my
      man! Become a citizen of a country where true worth has always its chance
      and one may hope to climb to any heights whatsoever.&rdquo; Quite like an
      advertisement he talked, but I read their so-called Declaration, finding
      it snarky in the extreme and with no end of silly rot about equality. In
      no way at all did it solve the problems by which I had been so suddenly
      confronted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Social lines in the town seemed to have been drawn by no rule whatever.
      There were actually tradesmen who seemed to matter enormously; on the
      other hand, there were those of undoubted qualifications, like Mrs.
      Pettengill, for example, and Cousin Egbert, who deliberately chose not to
      matter, and mingled as freely with the Bohemian set as they did with the
      county families. Thus one could never be quite certain whom one was
      meeting. There was the Tuttle person. I had learned from Mrs. Effie in
      Paris that he was an Indian (accounting for much that was startling in his
      behaviour there) yet despite his being an aborigine I now learned that his
      was one of the county families and he and his white American wife were
      guests at that first dinner. Throughout the meal both Cousin Egbert and he
      winked atrociously at me whenever they could catch my eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, again, an English person calling himself Hobbs, a baker, to
      whom Cousin Egbert presented me, full of delight at the idea that as
      compatriots we were bound to be congenial. Yet it needed only a glance and
      a moment&rsquo;s listening to the fellow&rsquo;s execrable cockney dialect to perceive
      that he was distinctly low-class, and I was immensely relieved, upon
      inquiry, to learn that he affiliated only with the Bohemian set. I felt a
      marked antagonism between us at that first meeting; the fellow eyed me
      with frank suspicion and displayed a taste for low chaffing which I felt
      bound to rebuke. He it was, I may now disclose, who later began a fashion
      of referring to me as &ldquo;Lord Algy,&rdquo; which I found in the worst possible
      taste. &ldquo;Sets himself up for a gentleman, does he? He ain&rsquo;t no more a
      gentleman than wot I be!&rdquo; This speech of his reported to me will show how
      impossible the creature was. He was simply a person one does not know, and
      I was not long in letting him see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was the woman who was to play so active a part in my later
      history, of whom it will be well to speak at once. I had remarked her on
      the main street before I knew her identity. I am bound to say she stood
      out from the other women of Red Gap by reason of a certain dash, not to
      say beauty. Rather above medium height and of pleasingly full figure, her
      face was piquantly alert, with long-lashed eyes of a peculiar green, a
      small nose, the least bit raised, a lifted chin, and an abundance of
      yellowish hair. But it was the expertness of her gowning that really held
      my attention at that first view, and the fact that she knew what to put on
      her head. For the most part, the ladies I had met were well enough gotten
      up yet looked curiously all wrong, lacking a genius for harmony of detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      This person, I repeat, displayed a taste that was faultless, a knowledge
      of the peculiar needs of her face and figure that was unimpeachable.
      Rather with regret it was I found her to be a Mrs. Kenner, the leader of
      the Bohemian set. And then came the further items that marked her as one
      that could not be taken up. Perhaps a summary of these may be conveyed
      when I say that she had long been known as Klondike Kate. She had some
      years before, it seemed, been a dancing person in the far Alaska north and
      had there married the proprietor of one of the resorts in which she
      disported herself&mdash;a man who had accumulated a very sizable fortune
      in his public house and who was shot to death by one of his patrons who
      had alleged unfairness in a game of chance. The widow had then purchased a
      townhouse in Red Gap and had quickly gathered about her what was known as
      the Bohemian set, the county families, of course, refusing to know her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that first brief study of her I could more easily account for the
      undercurrents of bitterness I had felt in Red Gap society. She would be, I
      saw, a dangerous woman in any situation where she was opposed; there was
      that about her&mdash;a sort of daring disregard of the established social
      order. I was not surprised to learn that the men of the community strongly
      favoured her, especially the younger dancing set who were not restrained
      by domestic considerations. Small wonder then that the women of the &ldquo;old
      noblesse,&rdquo; as I may call them, were outspokenly bitter in their comments
      upon her. This I discovered when I attended an afternoon meeting of the
      ladies&rsquo; &ldquo;Onwards and Upwards Club,&rdquo; which, I had been told, would be
      devoted to a study of the English Lake poets, and where, it having been
      discovered that I read rather well, I had consented to favour the assembly
      with some of the more significant bits from these bards. The meeting, I
      regret to say, after a formal enough opening was diverted from its
      original purpose, the time being occupied in a quite heated discussion of
      a so-called &ldquo;Dutch Supper&rdquo; the Klondike person had given the evening
      before, the same having been attended, it seemed, by the husbands of at
      least three of those present, who had gone incognito, as it were. At no
      time during the ensuing two hours was there a moment that seemed opportune
      for the introduction of some of our noblest verse.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, by often painful stages, did my education progress. At the country
      club I played golf with Mr. Jackson. At social affairs I appeared with the
      Flouds. I played bridge. I danced the more dignified dances. And, though
      there was no proper church in the town&mdash;only dissenting chapels,
      Methodist, Presbyterian, and such outlandish persuasions&mdash;I attended
      services each Sabbath, and more than once had tea with what at home would
      have been the vicar of the parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now, when I had begun to feel a bit at ease in my queer foreign
      environment, that Mr. Belknap-Jackson broached his ill-starred plan for
      amateur theatricals. At the first suggestion of this I was immensely taken
      with the idea, suspecting that he would perhaps present &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; a part
      to which I have devoted long and intelligent study and to which I feel
      that I could bring something which has not yet been imparted to it by even
      the most skilled of our professional actors. But at my suggestion of this
      Mr. Belknap-Jackson informed me that he had already played Hamlet himself
      the year before, leaving nothing further to be done in that direction, and
      he wished now to attempt something more difficult; something, moreover,
      that would appeal to the little group of thinking people about us&mdash;he
      would have &ldquo;a little theatre of ideas,&rdquo; as he phrased it&mdash;and he had
      chosen for his first offering a play entitled &ldquo;Ghosts&rdquo; by the foreign
      dramatist Ibsen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suspected at first that this might be a farce where a supposititious
      ghost brings about absurd predicaments in a country house, having seen
      something along these lines, but a reading of the thing enlightened me as
      to its character, which, to put it bluntly, is rather thick. There is a
      strain of immorality running through it which I believe cannot be too
      strongly condemned if the world is to be made better, and this is rendered
      the more repugnant to right-thinking people by the fact that the
      participants are middle-class persons who converse in quite commonplace
      language such as one may hear any day in the home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrongdoing is surely never so objectionable as when it is indulged in by
      common people and talked about in ordinary language, and the language of
      this play is not stage language at all. Immorality such as one gets in
      Shakespeare is of so elevated a character that one accepts it, the
      language having a grandeur incomparably above what any person was ever
      capable of in private life, being always elegant and unnatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I felt this strongly, I was in no position to urge my objections,
      and at length consented to take a part in the production, reflecting that
      the people depicted were really foreigners and the part I would play was
      that of a clergyman whose behaviour throughout is above reproach. For
      himself Mr. Jackson had chosen the part of Oswald, a youth who goes quite
      dotty at the last for reasons which are better not talked about. His wife
      was to play the part of a serving-maid, who was rather a baggage, while
      Mrs. Judge Ballard was to enact his mother. (I may say in passing I have
      learned that the plays of this foreigner are largely concerned with people
      who have been queer at one time or another, so that one&rsquo;s parentage is
      often uncertain, though they always pay for it by going off in the head
      before the final curtain. I mean to say, there is too much neighbourhood
      scandal in them.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There remained but one part to fill, that of the father of the
      serving-maid, an uncouth sort of drinking-man, quite low-class, who, in my
      opinion, should never have been allowed on the stage at all, since no
      moral lesson is taught by him. It was in the casting of this part that Mr.
      Jackson showed himself of a forgiving nature. He offered it to Cousin
      Egbert, saying he was the true &ldquo;type&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;with his weak, dissolute
      face&rdquo;&mdash;and that &ldquo;types&rdquo; were all the rage in theatricals.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the latter heatedly declined the honour, but after being urged
      and browbeaten for three days by Mrs. Effie he somewhat sullenly
      consented, being shown that there were not many lines for him to learn.
      From the first, I think, he was rendered quite miserable by the ordeal
      before him, yet he submitted to the rehearsals with a rather pathetic
      desire to please, and for a time all seemed well. Many an hour found him
      mugging away at the book, earnestly striving to memorize the part, or, as
      he quaintly expressed it, &ldquo;that there piece they want me to speak.&rdquo; But as
      the day of our performance drew near it became evident to me, at least,
      that he was in a desperately black state of mind. As best I could I
      cheered him with words of praise, but his eye met mine blankly at such
      times and I could see him shudder poignantly while waiting the moment of
      his entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still all might have been well, I fancy, but for the extremely
      conscientious views of Mr. Jackson in the matter of our costuming and
      make-up. With his lines fairly learned, Cousin Egbert on the night of our
      dress rehearsal was called upon first to don the garb of the foreign
      carpenter he was to enact, the same involving shorts and gray woollen hose
      to his knees, at which he protested violently. So far as I could gather,
      his modesty was affronted by this revelation of his lower legs. Being at
      length persuaded to this sacrifice, he next submitted his face to Mr.
      Jackson, who adjusted it to a labouring person&rsquo;s beard and eyebrows,
      crimsoning the cheeks and nose heavily with grease-paint and crowning all
      with an unkempt wig.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result, I am bound to say, was artistic in the extreme. No one would
      have suspected the identity of Cousin Egbert, and I had hopes that he
      would feel a new courage for his part when he beheld himself. Instead,
      however, after one quick glance into the glass he emitted a gasp of horror
      that was most eloquent, and thereafter refused to be comforted, holding
      himself aloof and glaring hideously at all who approached him. Rather like
      a mad dog he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, when all was ready for our first act, Cousin Egbert
      was not to be found. I need not dwell upon the annoyance this occasioned,
      nor upon how a substitute in the person of our hall&rsquo;s custodian, or
      janitor, was impressed to read the part. Suffice it to tell briefly that
      Cousin Egbert, costumed and bedizened as he was, had fled not only the
      theatre but the town as well. Search for him on the morrow was unavailing.
      Not until the second day did it become known that he had been seen at
      daybreak forty miles from Red Gap, goading a spent horse into the wilds of
      the adjacent mountains. Our informant disclosed that one side of his face
      was still bearded and that he had kept glancing back over his shoulder at
      frequent intervals, as if fearful of pursuit. Something of his frantic
      state may also be gleaned from the circumstance that the horse he rode was
      one he had found hitched in a side street near the hall, its ownership
      being unknown to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest it may be said that our performance was given as scheduled,
      announcement being made of the sudden illness of Mr. Egbert Floud, and his
      part being read from the book in a rich and cultivated voice by the
      superintendent of the high school. Our efforts were received with
      respectful attention by a large audience, among whom I noted many of the
      Bohemian set, and this I took as an especial tribute to our merits. Mr.
      Belknap-Jackson, however, to whom I mentioned the circumstance, was
      pessimistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we have not heard the last of it. I am sure they came
      for no good purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were quite orderly in their behaviour,&rdquo; I suggested
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is why I suspect them. That Kenner woman, Hobbs, the baker, the
      others of their set&mdash;they&rsquo;re not thinking people; I dare say they
      never consider social problems seriously. And you may have noticed that
      they announce an amateur minstrel performance for a week hence. I&rsquo;m quite
      convinced that they mean to be vulgar to the last extreme&mdash;there has
      been so much talk of the behaviour of the wretched Floud, a fellow who
      really has no place in our modern civilization. He should be compelled to
      remain on his ranche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And indeed these suspicions proved to be only too well founded. That which
      followed was so atrociously personal that in any country but America we
      could have had an action against them. As Mr. Belknap-Jackson so bitterly
      said when all was over, &ldquo;Our boasted liberty has degenerated into
      license.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is best told in a few words, this affair of the minstrel performance,
      which I understood was to be an entertainment wherein the participants
      darkened themselves to resemble blackamoors. Naturally, I did not attend,
      it being agreed that the best people should signify their disapproval by
      staying away, but the disgraceful affair was recounted to me in all its
      details by more than one of the large audience that assembled. In the
      so-called &ldquo;grand first part&rdquo; there seemed to have been little that was
      flagrantly insulting to us, although in their exchange of conundrums,
      which is a peculiar feature of this form of entertainment, certain names
      were bandied about with a freedom that boded no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the after-piece that the poltroons gave free play to their
      vilest fancies. Our piece having been announced as &ldquo;Ghosts; a Drama for
      Thinking People,&rdquo; this part was entitled on their programme, &ldquo;Gloats; a
      Dram for Drinking People,&rdquo; a transposition that should perhaps suffice to
      show the dreadful lengths to which they went; yet I feel that the thing
      should be set down in full.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage was set as our own had been, but it would scarce be credited
      that the Kenner woman in male attire had made herself up in a curiously
      accurate resemblance to Belknap-Jackson as he had rendered the part of
      Oswald, copying not alone his wig, moustache, and fashion of speech, but
      appearing in a golfing suit which was recognized by those present as
      actually belonging to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was this the worst, for the fellow Hobbs had copied my own dress and
      make-up and persisted in speaking in an exaggerated manner alleged to
      resemble mine. This, of course, was the most shocking bad taste, and while
      it was quite to have been expected of Hobbs, I was indeed rather surprised
      that the entire assembly did not leave the auditorium in disgust the
      moment they perceived his base intention. But it was Cousin Egbert whom
      they had chosen to rag most unmercifully, and they were not long in
      displaying their clumsy attempts at humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the curtain went up they were searching for him, affecting to be
      unconscious of the presence of their audience, and declaring that the play
      couldn&rsquo;t go on without him. &ldquo;Have you tried all the saloons?&rdquo; asked one,
      to which another responded, &ldquo;Yes, and he&rsquo;s been in all of them, but now he
      has fled. The sheriff has put bloodhounds on his trail and promises to
      have him here, dead or alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then while we are waiting,&rdquo; declared the character supposed to represent
      myself, &ldquo;I will tell you a wheeze,&rdquo; whereupon both the female characters
      fell to their knees shrieking, &ldquo;Not that! My God, not that!&rdquo; while Oswald
      sneered viciously and muttered, &ldquo;Serves me right for leaving Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To show the infamy of the thing, I must here explain that at several
      social gatherings, in an effort which I still believe was praiseworthy, I
      had told an excellent wheeze which runs: &ldquo;Have you heard the story of the
      three holes in the ground?&rdquo; I mean to say, I would ask this in an
      interested manner, as if I were about to relate the anecdote, and upon
      being answered &ldquo;No!&rdquo; I would exclaim with mock seriousness, &ldquo;Well! Well!
      Well!&rdquo; This had gone rippingly almost quite every time I had favoured a
      company with it, hardly any one of my hearers failing to get the joke at a
      second telling. I mean to say, the three holes in the ground being three
      &ldquo;Wells!&rdquo; uttered in rapid succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course if one doesn&rsquo;t see it at once, or finds it a bit subtle, it&rsquo;s
      quite silly to attempt to explain it, because logically there is no
      adequate explanation. It is merely a bit of nonsense, and that&rsquo;s quite all
      to it. But these boors now fell upon it with their coarse humour, the
      fellow Hobbs pretending to get it all wrong by asking if they had heard
      the story about the three wells and the others replying: &ldquo;No, tell us the
      hole thing,&rdquo; which made utter nonsense of it, whereupon they all began to
      cry, &ldquo;Well! well! well!&rdquo; at each other until interrupted by a terrific
      noise in the wings, which was followed by the entrance of the supposed
      Cousin Egbert, a part enacted by the cab-driver who had conveyed us from
      the station the day of our arrival. Dragged on he was by the sheriff and
      two of the town constables, the latter being armed with fowling-pieces and
      the sheriff holding two large dogs in leash. The character himself was
      heavily manacled and madly rattled his chains, his face being disguised to
      resemble Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s after the beard had been adjusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo; exclaimed the supposed sheriff; &ldquo;the dogs ran him into the
      third hole left by the well-diggers, and we lured him out by making a
      noise like sour dough.&rdquo; During this speech, I am told, the character
      snarled continuously and tried to bite his captors. At this the woman, who
      had so deplorably unsexed herself for the character of Mr. Belknap-Jackson
      as he had played Oswald, approached the prisoner and smartly drew forth a
      handful of his beard which she stuffed into a pipe and proceeded to smoke,
      after which they pretended that the play went on. But no more than a few
      speeches had been uttered when the supposed Cousin Egbert eluded his
      captors and, emitting a loud shriek of horror, leaped headlong through the
      window at the back of the stage, his disappearance being followed by the
      sounds of breaking glass as he was supposed to fall to the street below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; exclaimed the mimic Oswald. &ldquo;Perhaps he has broken both his
      legs so he can&rsquo;t run off any more,&rdquo; at which the fellow Hobbs remarked in
      his affected tones: &ldquo;That sort of thing would never do with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This I learned aroused much laughter, the idea being that the remark had
      been one which I am supposed to make in private life, though I dare say I
      have never uttered anything remotely like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fellow is quite impossible,&rdquo; continued the spurious Oswald, with a
      doubtless rather clever imitation of Mr. Belknap-Jackson&rsquo;s manner. &ldquo;If he
      is killed, feed him to the goldfish and let one of the dogs read his part.
      We must get along with this play. Now, then. &lsquo;Ah! why did I ever leave
      Boston where every one is nice and proper?&rsquo;&rdquo; To which his supposed mother
      replied with feigned emotion: &ldquo;It was because of your father, my poor boy.
      Ah, what I had to endure through those years when he cursed and spoke
      disrespectfully of our city. &lsquo;Scissors and white aprons,&rsquo; he would cry
      out, &lsquo;Why is Boston?&rsquo; But I bore it all for your sake, and now you, too,
      are smoking&mdash;you will go the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But promise me, mother,&rdquo; returns Oswald, &ldquo;promise me if I ever get dusty
      in the garret, that Lord Algy here will tell me one of his funny wheezes
      and put me out of pain. You could not bear to hear me knocking Boston as
      poor father did. And I feel it coming&mdash;already my mother-in-law has
      bluffed me into admitting that Red Gap has a right to be on the same map
      with Boston if it&rsquo;s a big map.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this was the coarsely wretched buffoonery that refined people were
      expected to sit through! Yet worse followed, for at their climax, the
      mimic Oswald having gone quite off his head, the Hobbs person, still with
      the preposterous affectation of taking me off in speech and manner, was
      persuaded by the stricken mother to sing. &ldquo;Sing that dear old plantation
      melody from London,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;so that my poor boy may know there are
      worse things than death.&rdquo; And all this witless piffle because of a quite
      natural misunderstanding of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have before referred to what I supposed was an American plantation
      melody which I had heard a black sing at Brighton, meaning one of the
      English blacks who colour themselves for the purpose, but on reciting the
      lines at an evening affair, when the American folksongs were under
      discussion, I was told that it could hardly have been written by an
      American at all, but doubtless by one of our own composers who had taken
      too little trouble with his facts. I mean to say, the song as I had it,
      betrayed misapprehensions both of a geographical and faunal nature, but I
      am certain that no one thought the worse of me for having been deceived,
      and I had supposed the thing forgotten. Yet now what did I hear but that a
      garbled version of this song had been supposedly sung by myself, the Hobbs
      person meantime mincing across the stage and gesturing with a monocle
      which he had somehow procured, the words being quite simply:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Away down south in Michigan,
      Where I was a slave, so happy and so gay,
    &lsquo;Twas there I mowed the cotton and the cane.
    I used to hunt the elephants, the tigers, and giraffes,
      And the alligators at the break of day.
    But the blooming Injuns prowled about my cabin every night,
      So I&rsquo;d take me down my banjo and I&rsquo;d play,
    And I&rsquo;d sing a little song and I&rsquo;d make them dance with glee,
      On the banks of the Ohio far away.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I mean to say, there was nothing to make a dust about even if the song
      were not of a true American origin, yet I was told that the creature who
      sang it received hearty applause and even responded to an encore.

      CHAPTER TEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      I need hardly say that this public ridicule left me dazed. Desperately I
      recalled our calm and orderly England where such things would not be
      permitted. There we are born to our stations and are not allowed to forget
      them. We matter from birth, or we do not matter, and that&rsquo;s all to it.
      Here there seemed to be no stations to which one was born; the effect was
      sheer anarchy, and one might ridicule any one whomsoever. As was actually
      said in that snarky manifesto drawn up by the rebel leaders at the time
      our colonies revolted, &ldquo;All men are created free and equal&rdquo;&mdash;than
      which absurdity could go no farther&mdash;yet the lower middle classes
      seemed to behave quite as if it were true.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now through no fault of my own another awkward circumstance was
      threatening to call further attention to me, which was highly undesirable
      at this moment when the cheap one-and-six Hobbs fellow had so pointedly
      singled me out for his loathsome buffoonery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ten days before, walking alone at the edge of town one calm
      afternoon, where I might commune with Nature, of which I have always been
      fond, I noted an humble vine-clad cot, in the kitchen garden of which
      there toiled a youngish, neat-figured woman whom I at once recognized as a
      person who did occasional charring for the Flouds on the occasion of their
      dinners or receptions. As she had appeared to be cheerful and competent,
      of respectful manners and a quite marked intelligence, I made nothing of
      stopping at her gate for a moment&rsquo;s chat, feeling a quite decided relief
      in the thought that here was one with whom I need make no pretence, her
      social position being sharply defined.
    </p>
    <p>
      We spoke of the day&rsquo;s heat, which was bland, of the vegetables which she
      watered with a lawn hose, particularly of the tomatoes of which she was
      pardonably proud, and of the flowering vine which shielded her piazza from
      the sun. And when she presently and with due courtesy invited me to enter,
      I very affably did so, finding the atmosphere of the place reposeful and
      her conversation of a character that I could approve. She was dressed in a
      blue print gown that suited her no end, the sleeves turned back over her
      capable arms; her brown hair was arranged with scrupulous neatness, her
      face was pleasantly flushed from her agricultural labours, and her blue
      eyes flashed a friendly welcome and a pleased acknowledgment of the
      compliments I made her on the garden. Altogether, she was a person with
      whom I at once felt myself at ease, and a relief, I confess it was, after
      the strain of my high social endeavours.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a tour of the garden I found myself in the cool twilight of her
      little parlour, where she begged me to be seated while she prepared me a
      dish of tea, which she did in the adjoining kitchen, to a cheerful
      accompaniment of song, quite with an honest, unpretentious
      good-heartedness. Glad I was for the moment to forget the social rancors
      of the town, the affronted dignities of the North Side set, and the
      pernicious activities of the Bohemians, for here all was of a simple
      humanity such as I would have found in a farmer&rsquo;s cottage at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I rested in the parlour I could not but approve its general air of
      comfort and good taste&mdash;its clean flowered wall-paper, the pair of
      stuffed birds on the mantel, the comfortable chairs, the neat carpet, the
      pictures, and, on a slender-legged stand, the globe of goldfish. These I
      noted with an especial pleasure, for I have always found an intense
      satisfaction in their silent companionship. Of the pictures I noted
      particularly a life-sized drawing in black-and-white in a large gold
      frame, of a man whom I divined was the deceased husband of my hostess.
      There was also a spirited reproduction of &ldquo;The Stag at Bay&rdquo; and some
      charming coloured prints of villagers, children, and domestic animals in
      their lighter moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea being presently ready, I genially insisted that it should be served in
      the kitchen where it had been prepared, though to this my hostess at first
      stoutly objected, declaring that the room was in no suitable state. But
      this was a mere womanish hypocrisy, as the place was spotless, orderly,
      and in fact quite meticulous in its neatness. The tea was astonishingly
      excellent, so few Americans I had observed having the faintest notion of
      the real meaning of tea, and I was offered with it bread and butter and a
      genuinely satisfying compote of plums of which my hostess confessed
      herself the fabricator, having, as she quaintly phrased the thing, &ldquo;put it
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so, over this collation, we chatted for quite all of an hour. The lady
      did, as I have intimated, a bit of charring, a bit of plain sewing, and
      also derived no small revenue from her vegetables and fruit, thus
      managing, as she owned the free-hold of the premises, to make a decent
      living for herself and child. I have said that she was cheerful and
      competent, and these epithets kept returning to me as we talked. Her
      husband&mdash;she spoke of him as &ldquo;poor Judson&rdquo;&mdash;had been a carter
      and odd-job fellow, decent enough, I dare say, but hardly the man for her,
      I thought, after studying his portrait. There was a sort of foppish
      weakness in his face. And indeed his going seemed to have worked her no
      hardship, nor to have left any incurable sting of loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three cups of the almost perfect tea I drank, as we talked of her own
      simple affairs and of the town at large, and at length of her child who
      awakened noisily from slumber in an adjacent room and came voraciously to
      partake of food. It was a male child of some two and a half years, rather
      suggesting the generous good-nature of the mother, but in the most
      shocking condition, a thing I should have spoken strongly to her about at
      once had I known her better. Queer it seemed to me that a woman of her
      apparently sound judgment should let her offspring reach this terrible
      state without some effort to alleviate it. The poor thing, to be blunt,
      was grossly corpulent, legs, arms, body, and face being wretchedly fat,
      and yet she now fed it a large slice of bread thickly spread with butter
      and loaded to overflowing with the fattening sweet. Banting of the
      strictest sort was of course what it needed. I have had but the slightest
      experience with children, but there could be no doubt of this if its
      figure was to be maintained. Its waistline was quite impossible, and its
      eyes, as it owlishly scrutinized me over its superfluous food, showed from
      a face already quite as puffy as the Honourable George&rsquo;s. I did, indeed,
      venture so far as suggesting that food at untimely hours made for a
      too-rounded outline, but to my surprise the mother took this as a tribute
      to the creature&rsquo;s grace, crying, &ldquo;Yes, he wuzzum wuzzums a fatty ole
      sing,&rdquo; with an air of most fatuous pride, and followed this by announcing
      my name to it with concerned precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruggums,&rdquo; it exclaimed promptly, getting the name all wrong and staring
      at me with cold detachment; then &ldquo;Ruggums-Ruggums-Ruggums!&rdquo; as if it were
      a game, but still stuffing itself meanwhile. There was a sort of horrid
      fascination in the sight, but I strove as well as I could to keep my gaze
      from it, and the mother and I again talked of matters at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      I come now to speak of an incident which made this quite harmless visit
      memorable and entailed unforeseen consequences of an almost quite serious
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we sat at tea there stalked into the kitchen a nondescript sort of dog,
      a creature of fairish size, of a rambling structure, so to speak, coloured
      a puzzling grayish brown with underlying hints of yellow, with vast
      drooping ears, and a long and most saturnine countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite a shock it gave me when I looked up to find the beast staring at me
      with what I took to be the most hearty disapproval. My hostess paused in
      silence as she noted my glance. The beast then approached me, sniffed at
      my boots inquiringly, then at my hands with increasing animation, and at
      last leaped into my lap and had licked my face before I could prevent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need hardly say that this attention was embarrassing and most
      distasteful, since I have never held with dogs. They are doubtless well
      enough in their place, but there is a vast deal of sentiment about them
      that is silly, and outside the hunting field the most finely bred of them
      are too apt to be noisy nuisances. When I say that the beast in question
      was quite an American dog, obviously of no breeding whatever, my dismay
      will be readily imagined. Rather impulsively, I confess, I threw him to
      the floor with a stern, &ldquo;Begone, sir!&rdquo; whereat he merely crawled to my
      feet and whimpered, looking up into my eyes with a most horrid and
      sickening air of devotion. Hereupon, to my surprise, my hostess gayly
      called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, look at Mr. Barker&mdash;he&rsquo;s actually taken up with you right away,
      and him usually so suspicious of strangers. Only yesterday he bit an agent
      that was calling with silver polish to sell&mdash;bit him in the leg so I
      had to buy some from the poor fellow&mdash;and now see! He&rsquo;s as friendly
      with you as you could wish. They do say that dogs know when people are all
      right. Look at him trying to get into your lap again.&rdquo; And indeed the
      beast was again fawning upon me in the most abject manner, licking my
      hands and seeming to express for me some hideous admiration. Seeing that I
      repulsed his advances none too gently, his owner called to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down, Mr. Barker, down, sir! Get out!&rdquo; she continued, seeing that he paid
      her no attention, and then she thoughtfully seized him by the collar and
      dragged him to a safe distance where she held him, he nevertheless
      continuing to regard me with the most servile affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration: &ldquo;WHY, LOOK AT MR. BARKER&mdash;HE&rsquo;S ACTUALLY TAKEN UP WITH
      YOU RIGHT AWAY, AND HIM USUALLY SO SUSPICIOUS OF STRANGERS&rdquo;}
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruggums, Ruggums, Ruggums!&rdquo; exploded the child at this, excitedly waving
      the crust of its bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behave, Mr. Barker!&rdquo; called his owner again. &ldquo;The gentleman probably
      doesn&rsquo;t want you climbing all over him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of my visit was somewhat marred by the determination of Mr.
      Barker, as he was indeed quite seriously called, to force his monstrous
      affections upon me, and by the well-meant but often careless efforts of
      his mistress to restrain him. She, indeed, appeared to believe that I
      would feel immensely pleased at these tokens of his liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I took my leave after sincere expressions of my pleasure in the call,
      the child with its face one fearful smear of jam again waved its crust and
      shouted, &ldquo;Ruggums!&rdquo; while the dog was plainly bent on departing with me.
      Not until he had been secured by a rope to one of the porch stanchions
      could I safely leave, and as I went he howled dismally after violent
      efforts to chew the detaining rope apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I finished my stroll with the greatest satisfaction, for during the entire
      hour I had been enabled to forget the manifold cares of my position. Again
      it seemed to me that the portrait in the little parlour was not that of a
      man who had been entirely suited to this worthy and energetic young woman.
      Highly deserving she seemed, and when I knew her better, as I made no
      doubt I should, I resolved to instruct her in the matter of a more
      suitable diet for her offspring, the present one, as I have said, carrying
      quite too large a preponderance of animal fats. Also, I mused upon the
      extraordinary tolerance she accorded to the sad-faced but too
      demonstrative Mr. Barker. He had been named, I fancied, by some one with a
      primitive sense of humour, I mean to say, he might have been facetiously
      called &ldquo;Barker&rdquo; because he actually barked a bit, though adding the
      &ldquo;Mister&rdquo; to it seemed to be rather forcing the poor drollery. At any rate,
      I was glad to believe I should see little of him in his free state.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet it was precisely the curious fondness of this brute for myself
      that now added to my embarrassments. On two succeeding days I paused
      briefly at Mrs. Judson&rsquo;s in my afternoon strolls, finding the lady as
      wholesomely reposeful as ever in her effect upon my nature, but finding
      the unspeakable dog each time more lavish of his disgusting affection for
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, one day, when I had made back to the town and was in fact traversing
      the main commercial thoroughfare in a dignified manner, I was made aware
      that the brute had broken away to follow me. Close at my heels he skulked.
      Strong words hissed under my breath would not repulse him, and to blows I
      durst not proceed, for I suddenly divined that his juxtaposition to me was
      exciting amused comment among certain of the natives who observed us. The
      fellow Hobbs, in the doorway of his bake-shop, was especially offensive,
      bursting into a shout of boorish laughter and directing to me the
      attention of a nearby group of loungers, who likewise professed to become
      entertained. So situated, I was of course obliged to affect
      unconsciousness of the awful beast, and he was presently running joyously
      at my side as if secure in my approval, or perhaps his brute intelligence
      divined that for the moment I durst not turn upon him with blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did the true perversity of the situation at once occur to me. Not
      until we had gained one of the residence avenues did I realize the
      significance of the ill-concealed merriment we had aroused. It was not
      that I had been followed by a random cur, but by one known to be the dog
      of the lady I had called upon. I mean to say, the creature had advertised
      my acquaintance with his owner in a way that would lead base minds to
      misconstrue its extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoroughly maddened by this thought, and being now safely beyond close
      observers, I turned upon the animal to give it a hearty drubbing with my
      stick, but it drew quickly off, as if divining my intention, and when I
      hurled the stick at it, retrieved it, and brought it to me quite as if it
      forgave my hostility. Discovering at length that this method not only
      availed nothing but was bringing faces to neighbouring windows, and that
      it did not the slightest good to speak strongly to the beast, I had
      perforce to accompany it to its home, where I had the satisfaction of
      seeing its owner once more secure it firmly with the rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far a trivial annoyance one might say, but when the next day the
      creature bounded up to me as I escorted homeward two ladies from the
      Onwards and Upwards Club, leaping upon me with extravagant manifestations
      of delight and trailing a length of gnawed rope, it will be seen that the
      thing was little short of serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Barker,&rdquo; exclaimed one of the ladies, regarding me brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a cutlery shop I then bought a stout chain, escorted the brute to his
      home, and saw him tethered. The thing was rather getting on me. The
      following morning he waited for me at the Floud door and was beside
      himself with rapture when I appeared. He had slipped his collar. And once
      more I saw him moored. Each time I had apologized to Mrs. Judson for
      seeming to attract her pet from home, for I could not bring myself to say
      that the beast was highly repugnant to me, and least of all could I
      intimate that his public devotion to me would be seized upon by the
      coarser village wits to her disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw him so fascinated with any one before,&rdquo; explained the lady as
      she once more adjusted his leash. But that afternoon, as I waited in the
      trap for Mr. Jackson before the post-office, the beast seemed to appear
      from out the earth to leap into the trap beside me. After a rather
      undignified struggle I ejected him, whereupon he followed the trap madly
      to the country club and made a farce of my golf game by retrieving the
      ball after every drive. This time, I learned, the child had released him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is enough to add that for those remaining days until the present the
      unspeakable creature&rsquo;s mad infatuation for me had made my life well-nigh a
      torment, to say nothing of its being a matter of low public jesting.
      Hardly did I dare show myself in the business centres, for as surely as I
      did the animal found me and crawled to fawn upon me, affecting his release
      each day in some novel manner. Each morning I looked abroad from my window
      on arising, more than likely detecting his outstretched form on the walk
      below, patiently awaiting my appearance, and each night I was liable to
      dreams of his coming upon me, a monstrous creature, sad-faced but eager,
      tireless, resolute, determined to have me for his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Musing desperately over this impossible state of affairs, I was now
      surprised to receive a letter from the wretched Cousin Egbert, sent by the
      hand of the Tuttle person. It was written in pencil on ruled sheets
      apparently torn from a cheap notebook, quite as if proper pens and decent
      stationery were not to be had, and ran as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    DEAR FRIEND BILL:

    Well, Bill, I know God hates a quitter, but I guess I got
    a streak of yellow in me wider than the Comstock lode. I was
    kicking at my stirrups even before I seen that bunch of whiskers,
    and when I took a flash of them and seen he was intending I
    should go out before folks without any regular pants on, I says
    I can be pushed just so far. Well, Bill, I beat it like a bat
    out of hell, as I guess you know by this time, and I would like
    to seen them catch me as I had a good bronc. If you know whose
    bronc it was tell him I will make it all O.K. The bronc will be
    all right when he rests up some. Well, Bill, I am here on the
    ranche, where everything is nice, and I would never come back
    unless certain parties agree to do what is right. I would not
    speak pieces that way for the President of the U.S. if he ask
    me to on his bended knees. Well, Bill, I wish you would come
    out here yourself, where everything is nice. You can&rsquo;t tell what
    that bunch of crazies would be wanting you to do next thing with
    false whiskers and no right pants. I would tell them &ldquo;I can be
    pushed just so far, and now I will go out to the ranche with
    Sour-dough for some time, where things are nice.&rdquo; Well, Bill,
    if you will come out Jeff Tuttle will bring you Wednesday when
    he comes with more grub, and you will find everything nice. I
    have told Jeff to bring you, so no more at present, with kind
    regards and hoping to see you here soon.

                          Your true friend,

                                           E.G. FLOUD.

    P.S. Mrs. Effie said she would broaden me out. Maybe she did,
    because I felt pretty flat. Ha! ha!
</pre>
    <p>
      Truth to tell, this wild suggestion at once appealed to me. I had an
      impulse to withdraw for a season from the social whirl, to seek repose
      among the glens and gorges of this cattle plantation, and there try to
      adjust myself more intelligently to my strange new environment. In the
      meantime, I hoped, something might happen to the dog of Mrs. Judson; or he
      might, perhaps, in my absence outlive his curious mania for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Effie, whom I now consulted, after reading the letter of Cousin
      Egbert, proved to be in favour of my going to him to make one last appeal
      to his higher nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only he&rsquo;d stick out there in the brush where he belongs, I&rsquo;d let him
      stay,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t stick; he gets tired after awhile and
      drops in perhaps on the very night when we&rsquo;re entertaining some of the
      best people at dinner&mdash;and of course we&rsquo;re obliged to have him,
      though he&rsquo;s dropped whatever manners I&rsquo;ve taught him and picked up his old
      rough talk, and he eats until you wonder how he can. It&rsquo;s awful! Sometimes
      I&rsquo;ve wondered if it couldn&rsquo;t be adenoids&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lot of talk about
      those just now&mdash;some very select people have them, and perhaps
      they&rsquo;re what kept him back and made him so hopelessly low in his tastes,
      but I just know he&rsquo;d never go to a doctor about them. For heaven&rsquo;s sake,
      use what influence you have to get him back here and to take his rightful
      place in society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had a profound conviction that he would never take his rightful place in
      society, be it the fault of adenoids or whatever; that low passion of his
      for being pally with all sorts made it seem that his sense of values must
      have been at fault from birth, and yet I could not bring myself to abandon
      him utterly, for, as I have intimated, something in the fellow&rsquo;s nature
      appealed to me. I accordingly murmured my sympathy discreetly and set
      about preparations for my journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling instinctively that Cousin Egbert would not now be dressing for
      dinner, I omitted evening clothes from my box, including only a
      morning-suit and one of form-fitting tweeds which I fancied would do me
      well enough. But no sooner was my box packed than the Tuttle person
      informed me that I could take no box whatever. It appeared that all
      luggage would be strapped to the backs of animals and thus transported.
      Even so, when I had reduced myself to one park riding-suit and a small
      bundle of necessary adjuncts, I was told that the golf-sticks must be left
      behind. It appeared there would be no golf.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so quite early one morning I started on this curious pilgrimage from
      what was called a &ldquo;feed corral&rdquo; in a low part of the town. Here the Tuttle
      person had assembled a goods-train of a half-dozen animals, the luggage
      being adjusted to their backs by himself and two assistants, all using
      language of the most disgraceful character throughout the process. The
      Tuttle person I had half expected to appear garbed in his native dress&mdash;Mrs.
      Effie had once more referred to &ldquo;that Indian Jeff Tuttle&rdquo;&mdash;but he
      wore instead, as did his two assistants, the outing or lounge suit of the
      Western desperado, nor, though I listened closely, could I hear him
      exclaim, &ldquo;Ugh! Ugh!&rdquo; in moments of emotional stress as my reading had
      informed me that the Indian frequently does.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two assistants, solemn-faced, ill-groomed fellows, bore the curious
      American names of Hank and Buck, and furiously chewed the tobacco plant at
      all times. After betraying a momentary interest in my smart riding-suit,
      they paid me little attention, at which I was well pleased, for their
      manners were often repellent and their abrupt, direct fashion of speech
      quite disconcerting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tuttle person welcomed me heartily and himself adjusted the saddle to
      my mount, expressing the hope that I would &ldquo;get my fill of scenery,&rdquo; and
      volunteering the information that my destination was &ldquo;one sleep&rdquo; away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER ELEVEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although fond of rural surroundings and always interested in nature, the
      adventure in which I had become involved is not one I can recommend to a
      person of refined tastes. I found it little enough to my own taste even
      during the first two hours of travel when we kept to the beaten
      thoroughfare, for the sun was hot, the dust stifling, and the language
      with which the goods-animals were berated coarse in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet from this plain roadway and a country of rolling down and heather
      which was at least not terrifying, our leader, the Tuttle person, swerved
      all at once into an untried jungle, in what at the moment I supposed to be
      a fit of absent-mindedness, following a narrow path that led up a
      fearsomely slanted incline among trees and boulders of granite thrown
      about in the greatest disorder. He was followed, however, by the
      goods-animals and by the two cow-persons, so that I soon saw the new
      course must be intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mountains were now literally quite everywhere, some higher than
      others, but all of a rough appearance, and uninviting in the extreme. The
      narrow path, moreover, became more and more difficult, and seemed
      altogether quite insane with its twistings and fearsome declivities. One&rsquo;s
      first thought was that at least a bit of road-metal might have been put
      upon it. But there was no sign of this throughout our toilsome day, nor
      did I once observe a rustic seat along the way, although I saw an
      abundance of suitable nooks for these. Needless to say, in all England
      there is not an estate so poorly kept up.
    </p>
    <p>
      There being no halt made for luncheon, I began to look forward to
      tea-time, but what was my dismay to observe that this hour also passed
      unnoted. Not until night was drawing upon us did our caravan halt beside a
      tarn, and here I learned that we would sup and sleep, although it was
      distressing to observe how remote we were from proper surroundings. There
      was no shelter and no modern conveniences; not even a wash-hand-stand or
      water-jug. There was, of course, no central heating, and no electricity
      for one&rsquo;s smoothing-iron, so that one&rsquo;s clothing must become quite
      disreputable for want of pressing. Also the informal manner of cooking and
      eating was not what I had been accustomed to, and the idea of sleeping
      publicly on the bare ground was repugnant in the extreme. I mean to say,
      there was no <i>vie intime</i>. Truly it was a coarser type of wilderness
      than that which I had encountered near New York City.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animals, being unladen, were fitted with a species of leather bracelet
      about their forefeet and allowed to stray at their will. A fire was built
      and coarse food made ready. It is hardly a thing to speak of, but their
      manner of preparing tea was utterly depraved, the leaves being flung into
      a tin of boiling water and allowed to <i>stew</i>. The result was
      something that I imagine etchers might use in making lines upon their
      metal plates. But for my day&rsquo;s fast I should have been unequal to this, or
      to the crude output of their frying-pans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I was indeed glad that no sign of my dismay had escaped me, for the
      cow-persons, Hank and Buck, as I discovered, had given unusual care to the
      repast on my account, and I should not have liked to seem unappreciative.
      Quite by accident I overheard the honest fellows quarrelling about an
      oversight: they had, it seemed, left the finger-bowls behind; each was
      bitterly blaming the other for this, seeming to feel that the meal could
      not go forward. I had not to be told that they would not ordinarily carry
      finger-bowls for their own use, and that the forgotten utensils must have
      been meant solely for my comfort. Accordingly, when the quarrel was at its
      highest I broke in upon it, protesting that the oversight was of no
      consequence, and that I was quite prepared to roughen it with them in the
      best of good fellowship. They were unable to conceal their chagrin at my
      having overheard them, and slunk off abashed to the cooking-fire. It was
      plain that under their repellent exteriors they concealed veins of the
      finest chivalry, and I took pains during the remainder of the evening to
      put them at their ease, asking them many questions about their wild life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the dangers of the jungle by which we were surrounded the most
      formidable, it seemed, was not the grizzly bear, of which I had read, but
      an animal quaintly called the &ldquo;high-behind,&rdquo; which lurks about
      camping-places such as ours and is often known to attack man in its search
      for tinned milk of which it is inordinately fond. The spoor of one of
      these beasts had been detected near our campfire by the cow-person called
      Buck, and he now told us of it, though having at first resolved to be
      silent rather than alarm us.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we carried a supply of the animal&rsquo;s favourite food, I was given two of
      the tins with instructions to hurl them quickly at any high-behind that
      might approach during the night, my companions arming themselves in a
      similar manner. It appears that the beast has tushes similar in shape to
      tin openers with which it deftly bites into any tins of milk that may be
      thrown at it. The person called Hank had once escaped with his life only
      by means of a tin of milk which had caught on the sabrelike tushes of the
      animal pursuing him, thus rendering him harmless and easy of capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Needless to say, I was greatly interested in this animal of the quaint
      name, and resolved to remain on watch during the night in the hope of
      seeing one, but at this juncture we were rejoined by the Tuttle person,
      who proceeded to recount to Hank and Buck a highly coloured version of my
      regrettable encounter with Mr. C. Belknap-Jackson back in the New York
      wilderness, whereat they both lost interest in the high-behind and greatly
      embarrassed me with their congratulations upon this lesser matter. Cousin
      Egbert, it seemed, had most indiscreetly talked of the thing, which was
      now a matter of common gossip in Red Gap. Thereafter I could get from them
      no further information about the habits of the high-behind, nor did I
      remain awake to watch for one as I had resolved to, the fatigues of the
      day proving too much for me. But doubtless none approached during the
      night, as the two tins of milk with which I was armed were untouched when
      I awoke at dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again we set off after a barbarous breakfast, driving our laden animals
      ever deeper into the mountain fastness, until it seemed that none of us
      could ever emerge, for I had ascertained that there was not a compass in
      the party. There was now a certain new friendliness in the manner of the
      two cow-persons toward me, born, it would seem, of their knowledge of my
      assault upon Belknap-Jackson, and I was somewhat at a loss to know how to
      receive this, well intentioned though it was. I mean to say, they were
      undoubtedly of the servant-class, and of course one must remember one&rsquo;s
      own position, but I at length decided to be quite friendly and American
      with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth must be told that I was now feeling in quite a bit of a funk and
      should have welcomed any friendship offered me; I even found myself
      remembering with rather a pensive tolerance the attentions of Mr. Barker,
      though doubtless back in Red Gap I should have found them as loathsome as
      ever. My hump was due, I made no doubt, first, to my precarious position
      in the wilderness, but more than that to my anomalous social position, for
      it seemed to me now that I was neither fish nor fowl. I was no longer a
      gentleman&rsquo;s man&mdash;the familiar boundaries of that office had been
      swept away; on the other hand, I was most emphatically not the gentleman I
      had set myself up to be, and I was weary of the pretence. The friendliness
      of these uncouth companions, then, proved doubly welcome, for with them I
      could conduct myself in a natural manner, happily forgetting my former
      limitations and my present quite fictitious dignities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I even found myself talking to them of cricket as we rode, telling them I
      had once hit an eight&mdash;fully run out it was and not an overthrow&mdash;though
      I dare say it meant little to them. I also took pains to describe to them
      the correct method of brewing tea, which they promised thereafter to
      observe, though this I fear they did from mere politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our way continued adventurously upward until mid-afternoon, when we began
      an equally adventurous descent through a jungle of pine trees, not a few
      of which would have done credit to one of our own parks, though there
      were, of course, too many of them here to be at all effective. Indeed, it
      may be said that from a scenic standpoint everything through which we had
      passed was overdone: mountains, rocks, streams, trees, all sounding a
      characteristic American note of exaggeration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then at last we came to the wilderness abode of Cousin Egbert. A rude hut
      of native logs it was, set in this highland glen beside a tarn. From afar
      we descried its smoke, and presently in the doorway observed Cousin Egbert
      himself, who waved cheerfully at us. His appearance gave me a shock. Quite
      aware of his inclination to laxness, I was yet unprepared for his present
      state. Never, indeed, have I seen a man so badly turned out. Too evidently
      unshaven since his disappearance, he was gotten up in a faded flannel
      shirt, open at the neck and without the sign of cravat, a pair of
      overalls, also faded and quite wretchedly spotty, and boots of the most
      shocking description. Yet in spite of this dreadful tenue he greeted me
      without embarrassment and indeed with a kind of artless pleasure. Truly
      the man was impossible, and when I observed the placard he had allowed to
      remain on the waistband of his overalls, boastfully alleging their
      indestructibility, my sympathies flew back to Mrs. Effie. There was a
      cartoon emblazoned on this placard, depicting the futile efforts of two
      teams of stout horses, each attached to a leg of the garment, to wrench it
      in twain. I mean to say, one might be reduced to overalls, but this
      blatant emblem was not a thing any gentleman need have retained. And
      again, observing his footgear, I was glad to recall that I had included a
      plentiful supply of boot-cream in my scanty luggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three of the goods-animals were now unladen, their burden of provisions
      being piled beside the door while Cousin Egbert chatted gayly with the
      cow-persons and the Indian Tuttle, after which these three took their
      leave, being madly bent, it appeared, upon penetrating still farther into
      the wilderness to another cattle farm. Then, left alone with Cousin
      Egbert, I was not long in discovering that, strictly speaking, he had no
      establishment. Not only were there no servants, but there were no drains,
      no water-taps, no ice-machine, no scullery, no central heating, no
      electric wiring. His hut consisted of but a single room, and this without
      a floor other than the packed earth, while the appointments were such as
      in any civilized country would have indicated the direst poverty. Two beds
      of the rudest description stood in opposite corners, and one end of the
      room was almost wholly occupied by a stone fireplace of primitive
      construction, over which the owner now hovered in certain feats of
      cookery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to my famished state I was in no mood to criticise his efforts,
      which he presently set forth upon the rough deal table in a hearty but
      quite inelegant manner. The meal, I am bound to say, was more than welcome
      to my now indiscriminating palate, though at a less urgent moment I should
      doubtless have found the bread soggy and the beans a pernicious mass.
      There was a stew of venison, however, which only the most skilful hands
      could have bettered, though how the man had obtained a deer was beyond me,
      since it was evident he possessed no shooting or deer-stalking costume. As
      to the tea, I made bold to speak my mind and succeeded in brewing some for
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the repast Cousin Egbert was constantly attentive to my needs
      and was more cheerful of demeanour than I had ever seen him. The hunted
      look about his eyes, which had heretofore always distinguished him, was
      now gone, and he bore himself like a free man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he said, as we smoked over the remains of the meal, &ldquo;you stay
      with me and I&rsquo;ll give you one swell little time. I&rsquo;ll do the cooking, and
      between whiles we can sit right here and play cribbage day in and day out.
      You can get a taste of real life without moving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw then, if never before, that his deeper nature would not be aroused.
      Doubtless my passing success with him in Paris had marked the very highest
      stage of his spiritual development. I did not need to be told now that he
      had left off sock-suspenders forever, nor did I waste words in trying to
      recall him to his better self. Indeed for the moment I was too overwhelmed
      by fatigue even to remonstrate about his wretched lounge-suit, and I early
      fell asleep on one of the beds while he was still engaged in washing the
      metal dishes upon which we had eaten, singing the while the doleful ballad
      of &ldquo;Rosalie, the Prairie Flower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed but a moment later that I awoke, for Cousin Egbert was again
      busy among the dishes, but I saw that another day had come and his song
      had changed to one equally sad but quite different. &ldquo;In the hazel dell my
      Nellie&rsquo;s sleeping,&rdquo; he sang, though in a low voice and quite cheerfully.
      Indeed his entire repertoire of ballads was confined to the saddest
      themes, chiefly of desirable maidens taken off untimely either by disease
      or accident. Besides &ldquo;Rosalie, the Prairie Flower,&rdquo; there was &ldquo;Lovely
      Annie Lisle,&rdquo; over whom the willows waved and earthly music could not
      waken; another named &ldquo;Sweet Alice Ben Bolt&rdquo; lying in the churchyard, and
      still another, &ldquo;Lily Dale,&rdquo; who was pictured &ldquo;&lsquo;neath the trees in the
      flowery vale,&rdquo; with the wild rose blossoming o&rsquo;er the little green grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was indeed sad as he rendered these woful ballads and yet his
      voice and manner were of the cheeriest, and I dare say he sang without
      reference to their real tragedy. It was a school of American balladry
      quite at variance with the cheerful optimism of those I had heard from the
      Belknap-Jackson phonograph, where the persons are not dead at all but are
      gayly calling upon one another to come on and do a folkdance, or hear a
      band or crawl under&mdash;things of that sort. As Cousin Egbert bent over
      a frying pan in which ham was cooking he crooned softly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;In the hazel dell my Nellie&rsquo;s sleeping,
      Nellie loved so long,
    While my lonely, lonely watch I&rsquo;m keeping,
      Nellie lost and gone.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I could attribute his choice only to that natural perversity which
      prompted him always to do the wrong thing, for surely this affecting verse
      was not meant to be sung at such a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attempting to arise, I became aware that the two days&rsquo; journey had left me
      sadly lame and wayworn, also that my face was burned from the sun and that
      I had been awakened too soon. Fortunately I had with me a shilling jar of
      Ridley&rsquo;s Society Complexion Food, &ldquo;the all-weather wonder,&rdquo; which I
      applied to my face with cooling results, and I then felt able to partake
      of a bit of the breakfast which Cousin Egbert now brought to my bedside.
      The ham was of course not cooked correctly and the tea was again a mere
      corrosive, but so anxious was my host to please me that I refrained from
      any criticism, though at another time I should have told him straight what
      I thought of such cookery.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had both eaten I slept again to the accompaniment of another sad
      song and the muted rattle of the pans as Cousin Egbert did the scullery
      work, and it was long past the luncheon hour when I awoke, still lame from
      the saddle, but greatly refreshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now that another blow befell me, for upon arising and searching
      through my kit I discovered that my razors had been left behind. By any
      thinking man the effect of this oversight will be instantly perceived.
      Already low in spirits, the prospect of going unshaven could but aggravate
      my funk. I surrendered to the wave of homesickness that swept over me. I
      wanted London again, London with its yellow fog and greasy pavements, I
      wished to buy cockles off a barrow, I longed for toasted crumpets, and
      most of all I longed for my old rightful station; longed to turn out a
      gentleman, longed for the Honourable George and our peaceful if sometimes
      precarious existence among people of the right sort. The continued shocks
      since that fateful night of the cards had told upon me. I knew now that I
      had not been meant for adventure. Yet here I had turned up in the most
      savage of lands after leading a life of dishonest pretence in a station to
      which I had not been born&mdash;and, for I knew not how many days, I
      should not be able to shave my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here again a ferment stirred in my blood, some electric thrill of
      anarchy which had come from association with these Americans, a strange,
      lawless impulse toward their quite absurd ideals of equality, a monstrous
      ambition to be in myself some one that mattered, instead of that pretended
      Colonel Ruggles who, I now recalled, was to-day promised to bridge at the
      home of Mrs. Judge Ballard, where he would talk of hunting in the shires,
      of the royal enclosure at Ascot, of Hurlingham and Ranleigh, of Cowes in
      June, of the excellence of the converts at Chaynes-Wotten. No doubt it was
      a sort of madness now seized me, consequent upon the lack of shaving
      utensils.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered desperately if there was a true place for me in this life. I
      had tasted their equality that day of debauch in Paris, but obviously the
      sensation could not permanently be maintained upon spirits. Perhaps I
      might obtain a post in a bank; I might become a shop-assistant, bag-man,
      even a pressman. These moody and unwholesome thoughts were clouding my
      mind as I surveyed myself in the wrinkled mirror which had seemed to
      suffice the uncritical Cousin Egbert for his toilet. It hung between the
      portrait of a champion middle-weight crouching in position and the
      calendar advertisement of a brewery which, as I could not fancy Cousin
      Egbert being in the least concerned about the day of the month, had too
      evidently been hung on his wall because of the coloured lithograph of a
      blond creature in theatrical undress who smirked most immorally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Studying the curiously wavy effect this glass produced upon my face, I
      chanced to observe in a corner of the frame a printed card with the
      heading &ldquo;Take Courage!&rdquo; To my surprise the thing, when I had read it,
      capped my black musings upon my position in a rather uncanny way. Briefly
      it recited the humble beginnings of a score or more of the world&rsquo;s notable
      figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Demosthenes was the son of a cutler,&rdquo; it began. &ldquo;Horace was the son of a
      shopkeeper. Virgil&rsquo;s father was a porter. Cardinal Wolsey was the son of a
      butcher. Shakespeare the son of a wool-stapler.&rdquo; Followed the obscure
      parentage of such well-known persons as Milton, Napoleon, Columbus,
      Cromwell. Even Mohammed was noted as a shepherd and camel-driver, though
      it seemed rather questionable taste to include in the list one whose
      religion, as to family life, was rather scandalous. More to the point was
      the citation of various Americans who had sprung from humble beginnings:
      Lincoln, Johnson, Grant, Garfield, Edison. It is true that there was not,
      apparently, a gentleman&rsquo;s servant among them; they were rail-splitters,
      boatmen, tailors, artisans of sorts, but the combined effect was rather
      overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first moment of my encountering the American social system, it
      seemed, I had been by way of becoming a rabid anarchist&mdash;that is, one
      feeling that he might become a gentleman regardless of his birth&mdash;and
      here were the disconcerting facts concerning a score of notables to
      confirm me in my heresy. It was not a thing to be spoken lightly of in
      loose discussion, but there can be no doubt that at this moment I coldly
      questioned the soundness of our British system, the vital marrow of which
      is to teach that there is a difference between men and men. To be sure, it
      will have been seen that I was not myself, having for a quarter year been
      subjected to a series of nervous shocks, and having had my mind
      contaminated, moreover, by being brought into daily contact with this
      unthinking American equality in the person of Cousin Egbert, who, I make
      bold to assert, had never for one instant since his doubtless obscure
      birth considered himself the superior of any human being whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      This much I advance for myself in extenuation of my lawless imaginings,
      but of them I can abate no jot; it was all at once clear to me, monstrous
      as it may seem, that Nature and the British Empire were at variance in
      their decrees, and that somehow a system was base which taught that one
      man is necessarily inferior to another. I dare say it was a sort of
      poisonous intoxication&mdash;that I should all at once declare:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His lordship tenth Earl of Brinstead and Marmaduke Ruggles are two men;
      one has made an acceptable peer and one an acceptable valet, yet the twain
      are equal, and the system which has made one inferior socially to the
      other is false and bad and cannot endure.&rdquo; For a moment, I repeat, I saw
      myself a gentleman in the making&mdash;a clear fairway without bunkers
      from tee to green&mdash;meeting my equals with a friendly eye; and then
      the illumining shock, for I unconsciously added to myself, &ldquo;Regarding my
      inferiors with a kindly tolerance.&rdquo; It was there I caught myself. So much
      a part of the system was I that, although I could readily conceive a
      society in which I had no superiors, I could not picture one in which I
      had not inferiors. The same poison that ran in the veins of their
      lordships ran also in the veins of their servants. I was indeed, it
      appeared, hopelessly inoculated. Again I read the card. Horace was the son
      of a shopkeeper, but I made no doubt that, after he became a popular and
      successful writer of Latin verse, he looked down upon his own father. Only
      could it have been otherwise, I thought, had he been born in this
      fermenting America to no station whatever and left to achieve his rightful
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I mused thus licentiously until one clear conviction possessed me: that
      I would no longer pretend to the social superiority of one Colonel
      Marmaduke Ruggles. I would concede no inferiority in myself, but I would
      not again, before Red Gap&rsquo;s county families vaunt myself as other than I
      was. That this was more than a vagrant fancy on my part will be seen when
      I aver that suddenly, strangely, alarmingly, I no longer cared that I was
      unshaven and must remain so for an untold number of days. I welcomed the
      unhandsome stubble that now projected itself upon my face; I curiously
      wished all at once to be as badly gotten up as Cousin Egbert, with as
      little thought for my station in life. I would no longer refrain from
      doing things because they were &ldquo;not done.&rdquo; My own taste would be the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment that Cousin Egbert appeared in the doorway with four
      trout from the stream nearby, though how he had managed to snare them I
      could not think, since he possessed no correct equipment for angling. I
      fancy I rather overwhelmed him by exclaiming, &ldquo;Hello, Sour-dough!&rdquo; since
      never before had I addressed him in any save a formal fashion, and it is
      certain I embarrassed him by my next proceeding, which was to grasp his
      hand and shake it heartily, an action that I could explain no more than
      he, except that the violence of my self-communion was still upon me and
      required an outlet. He grinned amiably, then regarded me with a shrewd eye
      and demanded if I had been drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I am drunk with this,&rdquo; and held the card up to him. But
      when he took it interestedly he merely read the obverse side which I had
      not observed until now. &ldquo;Go to Epstein&rsquo;s for Everything You Wear,&rdquo; it said
      in large type, and added, &ldquo;The Square Deal Mammoth Store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They carry a nice stock,&rdquo; he said, still a bit puzzled by my tone,
      &ldquo;though I generally trade at the Red Front.&rdquo; I turned the card over for
      him and he studied the list of humble-born notables, though from a point
      of view peculiarly his own. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;what right they got
      to rake up all that stuff about people that&rsquo;s dead and gone. Who cares
      what their folks was!&rdquo; And he added, &ldquo;&lsquo;Horace was the son of a shopkeeper&rsquo;&mdash;Horace
      who?&rdquo; Plainly the matter did not excite him, and I saw it would be useless
      to try to convey to him what the items had meant to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to say, I&rsquo;m glad to be here with you,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d like it,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Everything is nice here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;America is some country,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is, she is,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And now you can bile up a pot of tea in
      your own way while I clean these here fish for sapper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made the tea. I regret to say there was not a tea cozy in the place;
      indeed the linen, silver, and general table equipment were sadly
      deficient, but in my reckless mood I made no comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your tea smells good, but it ain&rsquo;t got no kick to it,&rdquo; he observed over
      his first cup. &ldquo;When I drench my insides with tea I sort of want it to
      take a hold.&rdquo; And still I made no effort to set him right. I now saw that
      in all true essentials he did not need me to set him right. For so uncouth
      a person he was strangely commendable and worthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we sipped our tea in companionable silence, I busy with my new and
      disturbing thoughts, a long shout came to us from the outer distance.
      Cousin Egbert brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m darned if that ain&rsquo;t Ma Pettengill!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s rid over
      from the Arrowhead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We rushed to the door, and in the distance, riding down upon us at
      terrific speed, I indeed beheld the Mixer. A moment later she reigned in
      her horse before us and hoarsely rumbled her greetings. I had last seen
      her at a formal dinner where she was rather formidably done out in black
      velvet and diamonds. Now she appeared in a startling tenue of khaki
      riding-breeches and flannel shirt, with one of the wide-brimmed cow-person
      hats. Even at the moment of greeting her I could not but reflect how
      shocked our dear Queen would be at the sight of this riding habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dismounted with hearty explanations of how she had left her &ldquo;round-up&rdquo;
       and ridden over to visit, having heard from the Tuttle person that we were
      here. Cousin Egbert took her horse and she entered the hut, where to my
      utter amazement she at once did a feminine thing. Though from her garb one
      at a little distance might have thought her a man, a portly, florid,
      carelessly attired man, she made at once for the wrinkled mirror where,
      after anxiously scanning her burned face for an instant, she produced
      powder and puff from a pocket of her shirt and daintily powdered her
      generous blob of a nose. Having achieved this to her apparent
      satisfaction, she unrolled a bundle she had carried at her saddle and
      donned a riding skirt, buttoning it about the waist and smoothing down its
      folds&mdash;before I could retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now,&rdquo; she boomed, as if some satisfying finality had been brought
      about. Such was the Mixer. That sort of thing would never do with us, and
      yet I suddenly saw that she, like Cousin Egbert, was strangely commendable
      and worthy. I mean to say, I no longer felt it was my part to set her
      right in any of the social niceties. Some curious change had come upon me.
      I knew then that I should no longer resist America.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWELVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      With a curious friendly glow upon me I set about helping Cousin Egbert in
      the preparation of our evening meal, a work from which, owing to the
      number and apparent difficulty of my suggestions, he presently withdrew,
      leaving me in entire charge. It is quite true that I have pronounced views
      as to the preparation and serving of food, and I dare say I embarrassed
      the worthy fellow without at all meaning to do so, for too many of his
      culinary efforts betray the fumbling touch of the amateur. And as I worked
      over the open fire, doing the trout to a turn, stirring the beans, and
      perfecting the stew with deft touches of seasoning, I worded to myself for
      the first time a most severe indictment against the North American
      cookery, based upon my observations across the continent and my experience
      as a diner-out in Red Gap.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that it would never do with us, and that it ought, as a matter of
      fact, to be uplifted. Even then, while our guest chattered gossip of the
      town over her brown paper cigarettes, I felt the stirring of an impulse to
      teach Americans how to do themselves better at table. For the moment, of
      course, I was hampered by lack of equipment (there was not even a fish
      slice in the establishment), but even so I brewed proper tea and was able
      to impart to the simple viands a touch of distinction which they had
      lacked under Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s all-too-careless manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I served the repast Cousin Egbert produced a bottle of the brown
      American whiskey at which we pegged a bit before sitting to table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three rousing cheers!&rdquo; said he, and the Mixer responded with &ldquo;Happy
      days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As on that former occasion, the draught of spirits flooded my being with a
      vast consciousness of personal worth and of good feeling toward my
      companions. With a true insight I suddenly perceived that one might belong
      to the great lower middle-class in America and still matter in the truest,
      correctest sense of the term.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we fell hungrily to the food, the Mixer did not fail to praise my
      cooking of the trout, and she and Cousin Egbert were presently lamenting
      the difficulty of obtaining a well-cooked meal in Red Gap. At this I
      boldly spoke up, declaring that American cookery lacked constructive
      imagination, making only the barest use of its magnificent opportunities,
      following certain beaten and all-too-familiar roads with a slavish
      stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We nearly had a good restaurant,&rdquo; said the Mixer. &ldquo;A Frenchman came and
      showed us a little flash of form, but he only lasted a month because he
      got homesick. He had half the people in town going there for dinner, too,
      to get away from their Chinamen&mdash;and after I spent a lot of money
      fixing the place up for him, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I recalled the establishment, on the main street, though I had not known
      that our guest was its owner. Vacant it was now, and looking quite as if
      the bailiffs had been in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t cook ham and eggs proper,&rdquo; suggested Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;I tried
      him three times, and every time he done something French to &lsquo;em that
      nobody had ought to do to ham and eggs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon I ventured to assert that a too-intense nationalism would prove
      the ruin of any chef outside his own country; there must be a certain
      breadth of treatment, a blending of the best features of different
      schools. One must know English and French methods and yet be a slave to
      neither; one must even know American cookery and be prepared to adapt its
      half-dozen or so undoubted excellencies. From this I ventured further into
      a general criticism of the dinners I had eaten at Red Gap&rsquo;s smartest
      houses. Too profuse they were, I said, and too little satisfying in any
      one feature; too many courses, constructed, as I had observed, after
      photographs printed in the back pages of women&rsquo;s magazines; doubtless they
      possessed a certain artistic value as sights for the eye, but considered
      as food they were devoid of any inner meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bill&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert warmly. &ldquo;Mrs. Effie, she gets up about
      nine of them pictures, with nuts and grated eggs and scrambled tomatoes
      all over &lsquo;em, and nobody knowing what&rsquo;s what, and even when you strike one
      that tastes good they&rsquo;s only a dab of it and you mustn&rsquo;t ask for any more.
      When I go out to dinner, what I want is to have &lsquo;em say, &lsquo;Pass up your
      plate, Mr. Floud, for another piece of the steak and some potatoes, and
      have some more squash and help yourself to the quince jelly.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s how
      it had ought to be, but I keep eatin&rsquo; these here little plates of cut-up
      things and waiting for the real stuff, and first thing I know I get a
      spoonful of coffee in something like you put eye medicine into, and I know
      it&rsquo;s all over. Last time I was out I hid up a dish of these here salted
      almuns under a fern and et the whole lot from time to time, kind of absent
      like. It helped some, but it wasn&rsquo;t dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; put in the Mixer, saturating half a slice of bread in the
      sauce of the stew. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford to act otherwise than like I am a lady
      at one of them dinners, but the minute I&rsquo;m home I beat it for the icebox.
      I suppose it&rsquo;s all right to be socially elegant, but we hadn&rsquo;t ought to
      let it contaminate our food none. And even at that New York hotel this
      summer you had to make trouble to get fed proper. I wanted strawberry
      shortcake, and what do you reckon they dealt me? A thing looking like a
      marble palace&mdash;sponge cake and whipped cream with a few red spots in
      between. Well, long as we&rsquo;re friends here together, I may say that I
      raised hell until I had the chef himself up and told him exactly what to
      do; biscuit dough baked and prized apart and buttered, strawberries with
      sugar on &lsquo;em in between and on top, and plenty of regular cream. Well,
      after three days&rsquo; trying he finally managed to get simple&mdash;he just
      couldn&rsquo;t believe I meant it at first, and kept building on the whipped
      cream&mdash;and the thing cost eight dollars, but you can bet he had me,
      even then; the bonehead smarty had sweetened the cream and grated nutmeg
      into it. I give up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you can&rsquo;t get right food in New York, how can you expect to here?
      And Jackson, the idiot, has just fired the only real cook in Red Gap. Yes,
      sir; he&rsquo;s let the coons go. It come out that Waterman had sneaked out that
      suit of his golf clothes that Kate Kenner wore in the minstrel show, so he
      fired them both, and now I got to support &lsquo;em, because, as long as we&rsquo;re
      friends here, I don&rsquo;t mind telling you I egged the coon on to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that she was referring to the black and his wife whom I had met at
      the New York camp, though it seemed quaint to me that they should be
      called &ldquo;coons,&rdquo; which is, I take it, a diminutive for &ldquo;raccoon,&rdquo; a species
      of ground game to be found in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truth to tell, I enjoyed myself immensely at this simple but satisfying
      meal, feeling myself one with these homely people, and I was sorry when we
      had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was some little dinner itself,&rdquo; said the Mixer as she rolled a
      cigarette; &ldquo;and now you boys set still while I do up the dishes.&rdquo; Nor
      would she allow either of us to assist her in this work. When she had
      done, Cousin Egbert proceeded to mix hot toddies from the whiskey, and we
      gathered about the table before the open fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll have a nice home evening,&rdquo; said the Mixer, and to my great
      embarrassment she began at once to speak to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A strong man like him has got no business becoming a social butterfly,&rdquo;
       she remarked to Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bill&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; insisted the latter, as he had done so many times
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right so far, but let him go on for a year or so and he won&rsquo;t be
      a darned bit better than what Jackson is, mark my words. Just a social
      butterfly, wearing funny clothes and attending afternoon affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t say you ain&rsquo;t right,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert thoughtfully;
      &ldquo;that&rsquo;s one reason I got him out here where everything is nice. What with
      speaking pieces like an actor, I was afraid they&rsquo;d have him making more
      kinds of a fool of himself than what Jackson does, him being a foreigner,
      and his mind kind o&rsquo; running on what clothes a man had ought to wear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon, so flushed was I with the good feeling of the occasion, I told
      them straight that I had resolved to quit being Colonel Ruggles of the
      British army and associate of the nobility; that I had determined to
      forget all class distinctions and to become one of themselves, plain,
      simple, and unpretentious. It is true that I had consumed two of the hot
      grogs, but my mind was clear enough, and both my companions applauded this
      resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he can just get his mind off clothes for a bit he might amount to
      something,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert, and it will scarcely be credited, but at
      the moment I felt actually grateful to him for this admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll think about his case,&rdquo; said the Mixer, taking her own second toddy,
      whereupon the two fell to talking of other things, chiefly of their cattle
      plantations and the price of beef-stock, which then seemed to be six and
      one half, though what this meant I had no notion. Also I gathered that the
      Mixer at her own cattle-farm had been watching her calves marked with her
      monogram, though I would never have credited her with so much sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the retiring hour came, Cousin Egbert and I prepared to take our
      blankets outside to sleep, but the Mixer would have none of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last time I slept in here,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;mice was crawling over me
      all night, so you keep your shack and I&rsquo;ll bed down outside. I ain&rsquo;t
      afraid of mice, understand, but I don&rsquo;t like to feel their feet on my
      face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And to my great dismay, though Cousin Egbert took it calmly enough, she
      took a roll of blankets and made a crude pallet on the ground outside,
      under a spreading pine tree. I take it she was that sort. The least I
      could do was to secure two tins of milk from our larder and place them
      near her cot, in case of some lurking high-behind, though I said nothing
      of this, not wishing to alarm her needlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the hut Cousin Egbert and I partook of a final toddy before
      retiring. He was unusually thoughtful and I had difficulty in persuading
      him to any conversation. Thus having noted a bearskin before my bed, I
      asked him if he had killed the animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he shortly, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t lie for a bear as small as that.&rdquo; As he
      was again silent, I made no further approaches to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      From my first sleep I was awakened by a long, booming yell from our guest
      outside. Cousin Egbert and I reached the door at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; bellowed the Mixer, and we went out to her in the chill
      night. She sat up with the blankets muffled about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We start Bill in that restaurant,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;It come to me in a flash.
      I judge he&rsquo;s got the right ideas, and Waterman and his wife can cook for
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully!&rdquo; exclaimed Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;I was thinking he ought to have a
      gents&rsquo; furnishing store, on account of his mind running to dress, but you
      got the best idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stake him to the rent,&rdquo; she put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll stake him to the rest,&rdquo; exclaimed Cousin Egbert delightedly,
      and, strange as it may seem, I suddenly saw myself a licensed victualler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call it the &lsquo;United States Grill,&rsquo;&rdquo; I said suddenly, as if by
      inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three rousing cheers for the U.S. Grill!&rdquo; shouted Cousin Egbert to the
      surrounding hills, and repairing to the hut he brought out hot toddies
      with which we drank success to the new enterprise. For a half-hour, I dare
      say, we discussed details there in the cold night, not seeing that it was
      quite preposterously bizarre. Returning to the hut at last, Cousin Egbert
      declared himself so chilled that he must have another toddy before
      retiring, and, although I was already feeling myself the equal of any
      American, I consented to join him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before retiring again my attention centred a second time upon the
      bearskin before my bed and, forgetting that I had already inquired about
      it, I demanded of him if he had killed the animal. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said he;
      &ldquo;killed it with one shot just as it was going to claw me. It was an awful
      big one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morning found the three of us engrossed with the new plan, and by the time
      our guest rode away after luncheon the thing was well forward and I had
      the Mixer&rsquo;s order upon her estate agent at Red Gap for admission to the
      vacant premises. During the remainder of the day, between games of
      cribbage, Cousin Egbert and I discussed the venture. And it was now that I
      began to foresee a certain difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, I asked myself, would the going into trade of Colonel Marmaduke
      Ruggles be regarded by those who had been his social sponsors in Red Gap?
      I mean to say, would not Mrs. Effie and the Belknap-Jacksons feel that I
      had played them false? Had I not given them the right to believe that I
      should continue, during my stay in their town, to be one whom their county
      families would consider rather a personage? It was idle, indeed, for me to
      deny that my personality as well as my assumed origin and social position
      abroad had conferred a sort of prestige upon my sponsors; that on my
      account, in short, the North Side set had been newly armed in its battle
      with the Bohemian set. And they relied upon my continued influence. How,
      then, could I face them with the declaration that I meant to become a
      tradesman? Should I be doing a caddish thing, I wondered?
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting the difficulty to Cousin Egbert, he dismissed it impatiently by
      saying: &ldquo;Oh, shucks!&rdquo; In truth I do not believe he comprehended it in the
      least. But then it was that I fell upon my inspiration. I might take
      Colonel Marmaduke Ruggles from the North Side set, but I would give them
      another and bigger notable in his place. This should be none other than
      the Honourable George, whom I would now summon. A fortnight before I had
      received a rather snarky letter from him demanding to know how long I
      meant to remain in North America and disclosing that he was in a wretched
      state for want of some one to look after him. And he had even hinted that
      in the event of my continued absence he might himself come out to America
      and fetch me back. His quarter&rsquo;s allowance, would, I knew, be due in a
      fortnight, and my letter would reach him, therefore, before some
      adventurer had sold him a system for beating the French games of chance.
      And my letter would be compelling. I would make it a summons he could not
      resist. Thus, when I met the reproachful gaze of the C. Belknap-Jacksons
      and of Mrs. Effie, I should be able to tell them: &ldquo;I go from you, but I
      leave you a better man in my place.&rdquo; With the Honourable George Augustus
      Vane-Basingwell, next Earl of Brinstead, as their house guest, I made no
      doubt that the North Side set would at once prevail as it never had
      before, the Bohemian set losing at once such of its members as really
      mattered, who would of course be sensible of the tremendous social
      importance of the Honourable George.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there came moments in which I would again find myself in no end of a
      funk, foreseeing difficulties of an insurmountable character. At such
      times Cousin Egbert strove to cheer me with all sorts of assurances, and
      to divert my mind he took me upon excursions of the roughest sort into the
      surrounding jungle, in search either of fish or ground game. After three
      days of this my park-suit became almost a total ruin, particularly as to
      the trousers, so that I was glad to borrow a pair of overalls such as
      Cousin Egbert wore. They were a tidy fit, but, having resolved not to
      resist America any longer, I donned them without even removing the
      advertising placard.
    </p>
    <p>
      With my ever-lengthening stubble of beard it will be understood that I now
      appeared as one of their hearty Western Americans of the roughest type,
      which was almost quite a little odd, considering my former principles.
      Cousin Egbert, I need hardly say, was immensely pleased with my changed
      appearance, and remarked that I was &ldquo;sure a live wire.&rdquo; He also heartened
      me in the matter of the possible disapproval of C. Belknap-Jackson, which
      he had divined was the essential rabbit in my moodiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit the guy uses beautiful language,&rdquo; he conceded, &ldquo;and probably he&rsquo;s
      top-notched in education, but jest the same he ain&rsquo;t the whole seven
      pillars of the house of wisdom, not by a long shot. If he gets fancy with
      you, sock him again. You done it once.&rdquo; So far was the worthy fellow from
      divining the intimate niceties involved in my giving up a social career
      for trade. Nor could he properly estimate the importance of my plan to
      summon the Honourable George to Red Gap, merely remarking that the &ldquo;Judge&rdquo;
       was all right and a good mixer and that the boys would give him a swell
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our return journey to Red Gap was made in company with the Indian Tuttle,
      and the two cow-persons, Hank and Buck, all of whom professed themselves
      glad to meet me again, and they, too, were wildly enthusiastic at hearing
      from Cousin Egbert of my proposed business venture. Needless to say they
      were of a class that would bother itself little with any question of
      social propriety involved in my entering trade, and they were loud in
      their promises of future patronage. At this I again felt some misgiving,
      for I meant the United States Grill to possess an atmosphere of quiet
      refinement calculated to appeal to particular people that really mattered;
      and yet it was plain that, keeping a public house, I must be prepared to
      entertain agricultural labourers and members of the lower or working
      classes. For a time I debated having an ordinary for such as these, where
      they could be shut away from my selecter patrons, but eventually decided
      upon a tariff that would be prohibitive to all but desirable people. The
      rougher or Bohemian element, being required to spring an extra shilling,
      would doubtless seek other places.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two days we again filed through mountain gorges of a most awkward
      character, reaching Red Gap at dusk. For this I was rather grateful, not
      only because of my beard and the overalls, but on account of a hat of the
      most shocking description which Cousin Egbert had pressed upon me when my
      own deer-stalker was lost in a glen. I was willing to roughen it in all
      good-fellowship with these worthy Americans, but I knew that to those who
      had remarked my careful taste in dress my present appearance would seem
      almost a little singular. I would rather I did not shock them to this
      extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet when our animals had been left in their corral, or rude enclosure, I
      found it would be ungracious to decline the hospitality of my new friends
      who wished to drink to the success of the U.S. Grill, and so I accompanied
      them to several public houses, though with the shocking hat pulled well
      down over my face. Also, as the dinner hour passed, I consented to dine
      with them at the establishment of a Chinese, where we sat on high stools
      at a counter and were served ham and eggs and some of the simpler American
      foods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meal being over, I knew that we ought to cut off home directly, but
      Cousin Egbert again insisted upon visiting drinking-places, and I had no
      mind to leave him, particularly as he was growing more and more bitter in
      my behalf against Mr. Belknap-Jackson. I had a doubtless absurd fear that
      he would seek the gentleman out and do him a mischief, though for the
      moment he was merely urging me to do this. It would, he asserted, vastly
      entertain the Indian Tuttle and the cow-persons if I were to come upon Mr.
      Belknap-Jackson and savage him without warning, or at least with only a
      paltry excuse, which he seemed proud of having devised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go up to the guy,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;very polite, you understand, and ask
      him what day this is. If he says it&rsquo;s Tuesday, sock him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is Tuesday,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where the joke comes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course this was the crudest sort of American humour and not to be given
      a moment&rsquo;s serious thought, so I redoubled my efforts to detach him from
      our honest but noisy friends, and presently had the satisfaction of doing
      so by pleading that I must be up early on the morrow and would also
      require his assistance. At parting, to my embarrassment, he insisted on
      leading the group in a cheer. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Ruggles?&rdquo; they
      loudly demanded in unison, following the query swiftly with: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all
      right!&rdquo; the &ldquo;he&rdquo; being eloquently emphasized.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last we were away from them and off into the darker avenue, to my
      great relief, remembering my garb. I might be a living wire, as Cousin
      Egbert had said, but I was keenly aware that his overalls and hat would
      rather convey the impression that I was what they call in the States a bad
      person from a bitter creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my further relief, the Floud house was quite dark as we approached and
      let ourselves in. Cousin Egbert, however, would enter the drawing-room,
      flood it with light, and seat himself in an easy-chair with his feet
      lifted to a sofa. He then raised his voice in a ballad of an infant that
      had perished, rendering it most tearfully, the refrain being, &ldquo;Empty is
      the cradle, baby&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; Apprehensive at this, I stole softly up the
      stairs and had but reached the door of my own room when I heard Mrs. Effie
      below. I could fancy the chilling gaze which she fastened upon the singer,
      and I heard her coldly demand, &ldquo;Where are your feet?&rdquo; Whereupon the
      plaintive voice of Cousin Egbert arose to me, &ldquo;Just below my legs.&rdquo; I mean
      to say, he had taken the thing as a quiz in anatomy rather than as the
      rebuke it was meant to be. As I closed my door, I heard him add that he
      could be pushed just so far.

      CHAPTER THIRTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Having written and posted my letter to the Honourable George the following
      morning, I summoned Mr. Belknap-Jackson, conceiving it my first duty to
      notify him and Mrs. Effie of my trade intentions. I also requested Cousin
      Egbert to be present, since he was my business sponsor.
    </p>
    <p>
      All being gathered at the Floud house, including Mrs. Belknap-Jackson, I
      told them straight that I had resolved to abandon my social career,
      brilliant though it had been, and to enter trade quite as one of their
      middle-class Americans. They all gasped a bit at my first words, as I had
      quite expected them to do, but what was my surprise, when I went on to
      announce the nature of my enterprise, to find them not a little intrigued
      by it, and to discover that in their view I should not in the least be
      lowering myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital, capital!&rdquo; exclaimed Belknap-Jackson, and the ladies emitted
      little exclamations of similar import.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last,&rdquo; said Mrs. Belknap-Jackson, &ldquo;we shall have a place with tone to
      it. The hall above will be splendid for our dinner dances, and now we can
      have smart luncheons and afternoon teas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a red-coated orchestra and after-theatre suppers,&rdquo; said Mrs. Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; put in Belknap-Jackson thoughtfully, &ldquo;he will of course be
      compelled to use discretion about his patrons. The rabble, of course&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He broke off with a wave of his hand which, although not pointedly, seemed
      to indicate Cousin Egbert, who once more wore the hunted look about his
      eyes and who sat by uneasily. I saw him wince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people&rsquo;s money is just as good as other people&rsquo;s if you come right
      down to it,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;and Bill is out for the coin. Besides, we all
      got to eat, ain&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Belknap-Jackson smiled deprecatingly and again waved his hand as if there
      were no need for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That rowdy Bohemian set&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Mrs. Effie, but I made bold
      to interrupt. There might, I said, be awkward moments, but I had no doubt
      that I should be able to meet them with a flawless tact. Meantime, for the
      ultimate confusion of the Bohemian set of Red Gap, I had to announce that
      the Honourable George Augustus Vane-Basingwell would presently be with us.
      With him as a member of the North Side set, I pointed out, it was not
      possible to believe that any desirable members of the Bohemian set would
      longer refuse to affiliate with the smartest people.
    </p>
    <p>
      My announcement made quite all the sensation I had anticipated.
      Belknap-Jackson, indeed, arose quickly and grasped me by the hand,
      echoing, &ldquo;The Honourable George Augustus Vane-Basingwell, brother of the
      Earl of Brinstead,&rdquo; with little shivers of ecstasy in his voice, while the
      ladies pealed their excitement incoherently, with &ldquo;Really! really!&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Actually coming to Red Gap&mdash;the brother of a lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then almost at once I detected curiously cold glances being darted at each
      other by the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we will be only too glad to put him up,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Belknap-Jackson quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear, he will of course come to us first,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Effie.
      &ldquo;Afterward, to be sure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so important that he should receive a favourable impression,&rdquo;
       responded Mrs. Belknap-Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Effie came back with not a little
      obvious warmth. Belknap-Jackson here caught my eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say Ruggles and I can be depended upon to decide a minor matter
      like that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies both broke in at this, rather sputteringly, but Cousin Egbert
      silenced them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shake dice for him,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;poker dice, three throws, aces low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shockingly vulgar!&rdquo; hissed Mrs. Belknap-Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if there were no other reason for his coming to us,&rdquo; remarked her
      husband coldly, &ldquo;there are certain unfortunate associations which ought to
      make his entertainment here quite impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re calling me &lsquo;unfortunate associations,&rsquo;&rdquo; remarked Cousin Egbert,
      &ldquo;you want to get it out of your head right off. I don&rsquo;t mind telling you,
      the Judge and I get along fine together. I told him when I was in Paris
      and Europe to look me up the first thing if ever he come here, and he said
      he sure would. The Judge is some mixer, believe me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Judge&rsquo;!&rdquo; echoed the Belknap-Jacksons in deep disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come right down to it&mdash;I bet a cookie he stays just where I tell
      him to stay,&rdquo; insisted Cousin Egbert. The evident conviction of his tone
      alarmed his hearers, who regarded each other with pained speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right where I tell him to stay and no place else,&rdquo; insisted Cousin
      Egbert, sensing the impression he had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is too monstrous!&rdquo; said Mr. Jackson, regarding me imploringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Honourable George,&rdquo; I admitted, &ldquo;has been known to do unexpected
      things, and there have been times when he was not as sensitive as I could
      wish to the demands of his caste&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bill is stalling&mdash;he knows darned well the Judge is a mixer,&rdquo; broke
      in Cousin Egbert, somewhat to my embarrassment, nor did any reply occur to
      me. There was a moment&rsquo;s awkward silence during which I became sensitive
      to a radical change in the attitude which these people bore to Cousin
      Egbert. They shot him looks of furtive but unmistakable respect, and Mrs.
      Effie remarked almost with tenderness: &ldquo;We must admit that Cousin Egbert
      has a certain way with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say Floud and I can adjust the matter satisfactorily to all,&rdquo;
       remarked Belknap-Jackson, and with a jaunty affection of good-fellowship,
      he opened his cigarette case to Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t made up my mind yet where I&rsquo;ll have him stay,&rdquo; announced the
      latter, too evidently feeling his newly acquired importance. &ldquo;I may have
      him stay one place, then again I may have him stay another. I can&rsquo;t decide
      things like that off-hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And here the matter was preposterously left, the aspirants for this social
      honour patiently bending their knees to the erstwhile despised Cousin
      Egbert, and the latter being visibly puffed up. By rather awkward stages
      they came again to a discussion of the United States Grill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The name, of course, might be thought flamboyant,&rdquo; suggested
      Belknap-Jackson delicately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have determined,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;no longer to resist America, and so I
      can think of no name more fitting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your determination,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;bears rather sinister implications.
      One may be vanquished by America as I have been. One may even submit; but
      surely one may always resist a little, may not one? One need not abjectly
      surrender one&rsquo;s finest convictions, need one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shucks,&rdquo; put in Cousin Egbert petulantly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use of all that
      &lsquo;one&rsquo; stuff? Bill wants a good American name for his place. Me? I first
      thought the &lsquo;Bon Ton Eating House&rsquo; would be kind of a nice name for it,
      but as soon as he said the &lsquo;United States Grill&rsquo; I knew it was a better
      one. It sounds kind of grand and important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Belknap-Jackson here made deprecating clucks, but not too directly toward
      Cousin Egbert, and my choice of a name was not further criticised. I went
      on to assure them that I should have an establishment quietly smart rather
      than noisily elegant, and that I made no doubt the place would give a new
      tone to Red Gap, whereat they all expressed themselves as immensely
      pleased, and our little conference came to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      In company with Cousin Egbert I now went to examine the premises I was to
      take over. There was a spacious corner room, lighted from the front and
      side, which would adapt itself well to the decorative scheme I had in
      mind. The kitchen with its ranges I found would be almost quite suitable
      for my purpose, requiring but little alteration, but the large room was of
      course atrociously impossible in the American fashion, with unsightly
      walls, the floors covered with American cloth of a garish pattern, and the
      small, oblong tables and flimsy chairs vastly uninviting.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the gross ideals of the former tenant, I need only say that he had
      made, as I now learned, a window display of foods, quite after the manner
      of a draper&rsquo;s window: moulds of custard set in a row, flanked on either
      side by &ldquo;pies,&rdquo; as the natives call their tarts, with perhaps a roast fowl
      or ham in the centre. Artistic vulgarity could of course go little beyond
      this, but almost as offensive were the abundant wall-placards pathetically
      remaining in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee like mother used to make,&rdquo; read one. Impertinently intimate this,
      professing a familiarity with one&rsquo;s people that would never do with us.
      &ldquo;Try our Boston Baked Beans,&rdquo; pleaded another, quite abjectly. And several
      others quite indelicately stated the prices at which different dishes
      might be had: &ldquo;Irish Stew, 25 cents&rdquo;; &ldquo;Philadelphia Capon, 35 cents&rdquo;;
      &ldquo;Fried Chicken, Maryland, 50 cents&rdquo;; &ldquo;New York Fancy Broil, 40 cents.&rdquo;
       Indeed the poor chap seemed to have been possessed by a geographical
      mania, finding it difficult to submit the simplest viands without
      crediting them to distant towns or provinces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s remarking that these bedizened placards would &ldquo;come
      in handy,&rdquo; I took pains to explain to him just how different the United
      States Grill would be. The walls would be done in deep red; the floor
      would be covered with a heavy Turkey carpet of the same tone; the present
      crude electric lighting fixtures must be replaced with indirect lighting
      from the ceiling and electric candlesticks for the tables. The latter
      would be massive and of stained oak, my general colour-scheme being red
      and brown. The chairs would be of the same style, comfortable chairs in
      which patrons would be tempted to linger. The windows would be heavily
      draped. In a word, the place would have atmosphere; not the loud and
      blaring, elegance which I had observed in the smartest of New York
      establishments, with shrieking decorations and tables jammed together, but
      an atmosphere of distinction which, though subtle, would yet impress
      shop-assistants, plate-layers and road-menders, hodmen, carters,
      cattle-persons&mdash;in short the middle-class native.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert, I fear, was not properly impressed with my plan, for he
      looked longingly at the wall-placards, yet he made the most loyal pretence
      to this effect, even when I explained further that I should probably have
      no printed menu, which I have always regarded as the ultimate vulgarity in
      a place where there are any proper relations between patrons and steward.
      He made one wistful, timid reference to the &ldquo;Try Our Merchant&rsquo;s Lunch for
      35 cents,&rdquo; after which he gave in entirely, particularly when I explained
      that ham and eggs in the best manner would be forthcoming at his order,
      even though no placard vaunted them or named their price. Advertising
      one&rsquo;s ability to serve ham and eggs, I pointed out to him, would be quite
      like advertising that one was a member of the Church of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this he meekly enough accompanied me to his bank, where he placed a
      thousand pounds to my credit, adding that I could go as much farther as I
      liked, whereupon I set in motion the machinery for decorating and
      furnishing the place, with particular attention to silver, linen, china,
      and glassware, all of which, I was resolved, should have an air of its
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did I neglect to seek out the pair of blacks and enter into an
      agreement with them to assist in staffing my place. I had feared that the
      male black might have resolved to return to his adventurous life of
      outlawry after leaving the employment of Belknap-Jackson, but I found him
      peacefully inclined and entirely willing to accept service with me, while
      his wife, upon whom I would depend for much of the actual cooking, was
      wholly enthusiastic, admiring especially my colour-scheme of reds. I
      observed at once that her almost exclusive notion of preparing food was to
      fry it, but I made no doubt that I would be able to broaden her scope,
      since there are of course things that one simply does not fry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The male black, or raccoon, at first alarmed me not a little by reason of
      threats he made against Belknap-Jackson on account of having been shopped.
      He nursed an intention, so he informed me, of putting snake-dust in the
      boots of his late employer and so bringing evil upon him, either by
      disease or violence, but in this I discouraged him smartly, apprising him
      that the Belknap-Jacksons would doubtless be among our most desirable
      patrons, whereupon his wife promised for him that he would do nothing of
      the sort. She was a native of formidable bulk, and her menacing glare at
      her consort as she made this promise gave me instant confidence in her
      power to control him, desperate fellow though he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the day, at the door of the silversmith&rsquo;s, Cousin Egbert hailed
      the pressman I had met on the evening of my arrival, and insisted that I
      impart to him the details of my venture. The chap seemed vastly
      interested, and his sheet the following morning published the following:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    THE DELMONICO OF THE WEST

    Colonel Marmaduke Ruggles of London and Paris, for the past
    two months a social favourite in Red Gap&rsquo;s select North Side
    set, has decided to cast his lot among us and will henceforth
    be reckoned as one of our leading business men. The plan of
    the Colonel is nothing less than to give Red Gap a truly élite
    and recherché restaurant after the best models of London and
    Paris, to which purpose he will devote a considerable portion
    of his ample means. The establishment will occupy the roomy
    corner store of the Pettengill block, and orders have already
    been placed for its decoration and furnishing, which will be
    sumptuous beyond anything yet seen in our thriving metropolis.

    In speaking of his enterprise yesterday, the Colonel remarked,
    with a sly twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;Demosthenes was the son of a
    cutler, Cromwell&rsquo;s father was a brewer, your General Grant was
    a tanner, and a Mr. Garfield, who held, I gather, an important
    post in your government, was once employed on a canal-ship, so
    I trust that in this land of equality it will not be presumptuous
    on my part to seek to become the managing owner of a restaurant
    that will be a credit to the fastest growing town in the state.

    &ldquo;You Americans have,&rdquo; continued the Colonel in his dry, inimitable
    manner, &ldquo;a bewildering variety of foodstuffs, but I trust I may
    be forgiven for saying that you have used too little constructive
    imagination in the cooking of it. In the one matter of tea,
    for example, I have been obliged to figure in some episodes
    that were profoundly regrettable. Again, amid the profusion of
    fresh vegetables and meats, you are becoming a nation of tinned
    food eaters, or canned food as you prefer to call it. This,
    I need hardly say, adds to your cost of living and also makes
    you liable to one of the most dreaded of modern diseases, a
    disease whose rise can be traced to the rise of the tinned-food
    industry. Your tin openers rasp into the tin with the result
    that a fine sawdust of metal must drop into the contents and
    so enter the human system. The result is perhaps negligible in
    a large majority of cases, but that it is not universally so
    is proved by the prevalence of appendicitis. Not orange or
    grape pips, as was so long believed, but the deadly fine rain
    of metal shavings must be held responsible for this scourge.
    I need hardly say that at the United States Grill no tinned
    food will be used.&rdquo;
 
    This latest discovery of the Colonel&rsquo;s is important if true.
    Be that as it may, his restaurant will fill a long-felt want,
    and will doubtless prove to be an important factor in the social
    gayeties of our smart set. Due notice of its opening will be
    given in the news and doubtless in the advertising columns of
    this journal.
</pre>
    <p>
      Again I was brought to marvel at a peculiarity of the American press, a
      certain childish eagerness for marvels and grotesque wonders. I had given
      but passing thought to my remarks about appendicitis and its relation to
      the American tinned-food habit, nor, on reading the chap&rsquo;s screed, did
      they impress me as being fraught with vital interest to thinking people;
      in truth, I was more concerned with the comparison of myself to a
      restaurateur of the crude new city of New York, which might belittle
      rather than distinguish me, I suspected. But what was my astonishment to
      perceive in the course of a few days that I had created rather a
      sensation, with attending newspaper publicity which, although bizarre
      enough, I am bound to say contributed not a little to the consideration in
      which I afterward came to be held by the more serious-minded persons of
      Red Gap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Busied with the multitude of details attending my installation, I was
      called upon by another press chap, representing a Spokane sheet, who
      wished me to elaborate my views concerning the most probable cause of
      appendicitis, which I found myself able to do with some eloquence,
      reciting among other details that even though the metal dust might be of
      an almost microscopic fineness, it could still do a mischief to one&rsquo;s
      appendix. The press chap appeared wholly receptive to my views, and, after
      securing details of my plan to smarten Red Gap with a restaurant of real
      distinction, he asked so civilly for a photographic portrait of myself
      that I was unable to refuse him. The thing was a snap taken of me one
      morning at Chaynes-Wotten by Higgins, the butler, as I stood by his
      lordship&rsquo;s saddle mare. It was not by any means the best likeness I have
      had, but there was a rather effective bit of background disclosing the
      driveway and the façade of the East Wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This episode I had well-nigh forgotten when on the following Sunday I
      found the thing emblazoned across a page of the Spokane sheet under a
      shrieking headline: &ldquo;Can Opener Blamed for Appendicitis.&rdquo; A secondary
      heading ran, &ldquo;Famous British Sportsman and Bon Vivant Advances Novel
      Theory.&rdquo; Accompanying this was a print of the photograph entitled,
      &ldquo;Colonel Marmaduke Ruggles with His Favourite Hunter, at His English
      Country Seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although the article made suitable reference to myself and my enterprise,
      it was devoted chiefly to a discussion of my tin-opening theory and was
      supplemented by a rather snarky statement signed by a physician declaring
      it to be nonsense. I thought the fellow might have chosen his words with
      more care, but again dismissed the matter from my mind. Yet this was not
      to be the last of it. In due time came a New York sheet with a most
      extraordinary page. &ldquo;Titled Englishman Learns Cause of Appendicitis,&rdquo; read
      the heading in large, muddy type. Below was the photograph of myself, now
      entitled, &ldquo;Sir Marmaduke Ruggles and His Favourite Hunter.&rdquo; But this was
      only one of the illustrations. From the upper right-hand corner a gigantic
      hand wielding a tin-opener rained a voluminous spray of metal, presumably,
      upon a cowering wretch in the lower left-hand corner, who was quite
      plainly all in. There were tables of statistics showing the increase, side
      by side of appendicitis and the tinned-food industry, a matter to which I
      had devoted, said the print, years of research before announcing my
      discovery. Followed statements from half a dozen distinguished surgeons,
      each signed autographically, all but one rather bluntly disagreeing with
      me, insisting that the tin-opener cuts cleanly and, if not man&rsquo;s best
      friend, should at least be considered one of the triumphs of civilization.
      The only exception announced that he was at present conducting laboratory
      experiments with a view to testing my theory and would disclose his
      results in due time. Meantime, he counselled the public to be not unduly
      alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the further flood of these screeds, which continued for the better part
      of a year, I need not speak. They ran the gamut from serious leaders in
      medical journals to paid ridicule of my theory in advertisements printed
      by the food-tinning persons, and I have to admit that in the end the
      public returned to a full confidence in its tinned foods. But that is
      beside the point, which was that Red Gap had become intensely interested
      in the United States Grill, and to this I was not averse, though I would
      rather I had been regarded as one of their plain, common sort, instead of
      the fictitious Colonel which Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s well-meaning stupidity had
      foisted upon the town. The &ldquo;Sir Marmaduke Ruggles and His Favourite
      Hunter&rdquo; had been especially repugnant to my finer taste, particularly as
      it was seized upon by the cheap one-and-six fellow Hobbs for some of his
      coarsest humour, he more than once referring to that detestable cur of
      Mrs. Judson&rsquo;s, who had quickly resumed his allegiance to me, as my
      &ldquo;hunting pack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other tradesmen of the town, I am bound to say, exhibited a friendly
      interest in my venture which was always welcome and often helpful. Even
      one of my competitors showed himself to be a dead sport by coming to me
      from time to time with hints and advice. He was an entirely worthy person
      who advertised his restaurant as &ldquo;Bert&rsquo;s Place.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go to Bert&rsquo;s Place for a
      Square Meal,&rdquo; was his favoured line in the public prints. He, also, I
      regret to say, made a practice of displaying cooked foods in his
      show-window, the window carrying the line in enamelled letters, &ldquo;Tables
      Reserved for Ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course between such an establishment and my own there could be little
      in common, and I was obliged to reject a placard which he offered me,
      reading, &ldquo;No Checks Cashed. This Means You!&rdquo; although he and Cousin Egbert
      warmly advised that I display it in a conspicuous place. &ldquo;Some of them
      dead beats in the North Side set will put you sideways if you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
       warned the latter, but I held firmly to the line of quiet refinement which
      I had laid down, and explained that I could allow no such inconsiderate
      mention of money to be obtruded upon the notice of my guests. I would
      devise some subtler protection against the dead beet-roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the matter of music, however, I was pleased to accept the advice of
      Cousin Egbert. &ldquo;Get one of them musical pianos that you put a nickel in,&rdquo;
       he counselled me, and this I did, together with an assorted repertoire of
      selections both classical and popular, the latter consisting chiefly of
      the ragging time songs to which the native Americans perform their
      folkdances.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as the date of my opening drew near, I began to suspect that its
      social values might become a bit complicated. Mrs. Belknap-Jackson, for
      example, approached me in confidence to know if she might reserve all the
      tables in my establishment for the opening evening, remarking that it
      would be as well to put the correct social cachet upon the place at once,
      which would be achieved by her inviting only the desirable people. Though
      she was all for settling the matter at once, something prompted me to take
      it under consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same evening Mrs. Effie approached me with a similar suggestion,
      remarking that she would gladly take it upon herself to see that the
      occasion was unmarred by the presence of those one would not care to meet
      in one&rsquo;s own home. Again I was non-committal, somewhat to her annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning I was sought by Mrs. Judge Ballard with the
      information that much would depend upon my opening, and if the matter were
      left entirely in her hands she would be more than glad to insure its
      success. Of her, also, I begged a day&rsquo;s consideration, suspecting then
      that I might be compelled to ask these three social leaders to unite
      amicably as patronesses of an affair that was bound to have a supreme
      social significance. But as I still meditated profoundly over the
      complication late that afternoon, overlooking in the meanwhile an
      electrician who was busy with my shaded candlesticks, I was surprised by
      the self-possessed entrance of the leader of the Bohemian set, the
      Klondike person of whom I have spoken. Again I was compelled to observe
      that she was quite the most smartly gowned woman in Red Gap, and that she
      marvellously knew what to put on her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She coolly surveyed my decorations and such of the furnishings as were in
      place before addressing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to engage one of your best tables,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;for your opening
      night&mdash;the tenth, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;this large one in the corner will
      do nicely. There will be eight of us. Your place really won&rsquo;t be half bad,
      if your food is at all possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The creature spoke with a sublime effrontery, quite as if she had not
      helped a few weeks before to ridicule all that was best in Red Gap
      society, yet there was that about her which prevented me from rebuking her
      even by the faintest shade in my manner. More than this, I suddenly saw
      that the Bohemian set would be a factor in my trade which I could not
      afford to ignore. While I affected to consider her request she tapped the
      toe of a small boot with a correctly rolled umbrella, lifting her chin
      rather attractively meanwhile to survey my freshly done ceiling. I may say
      here that the effect of her was most compelling, and I could well
      understand the bitterness with which the ladies of the Onwards and Upwards
      Society had gossiped her to rags. Incidently, this was the first correctly
      rolled umbrella, saving my own, that I had seen in North America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be pleased,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to reserve this table for you&mdash;eight
      places, I believe you said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left me as a duchess might have. She was that sort. I felt almost
      quite unequal to her. And the die was cast. I faced each of the three
      ladies who had previously approached me with the declaration that I was a
      licensed victualler, bound to serve all who might apply. That while I was
      keenly sensitive to the social aspects of my business, it was yet a
      business, and I must, therefore, be in supreme control. In justice to
      myself I could not exclusively entertain any faction of the North Side
      set, nor even the set in its entirety. In each instance, I added that I
      could not debar from my tables even such members of the Bohemian set as
      conducted themselves in a seemly manner. It was a difficult situation,
      calling out all my tact, yet I faced it with a firmness which was later to
      react to my advantage in ways I did not yet dream of.
    </p>
    <p>
      So engrossed for a month had I been with furnishers, decorators, char
      persons, and others that the time of the Honourable George&rsquo;s arrival drew
      on quite before I realized it. A brief and still snarky note had apprised
      me of his intention to come out to North America, whereupon I had all but
      forgotten him, until a telegram from Chicago or one of those places had
      warned me of his imminence. This I displayed to Cousin Egbert, who, much
      pleased with himself, declared that the Honourable George should be taken
      to the Floud home directly upon his arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant to rope him in there on the start,&rdquo; he confided to me, &ldquo;but I let
      on I wasn&rsquo;t decided yet, just to keep &lsquo;em stirred up. Mrs. Effie she
      butters me up with soft words every day of my life, and that Jackson lad
      has offered me about ten thousand of them vegetable cigarettes, but I&rsquo;ll
      have to throw him down. He&rsquo;s the human flivver. Put him in a car of
      dressed beef and he&rsquo;d freeze it between here and Spokane. Yes, sir; you
      could cut his ear off and it wouldn&rsquo;t bleed. I ain&rsquo;t going to run the
      Judge against no such proposition like that.&rdquo; Of course the poor chap was
      speaking his own backwoods metaphor, as I am quite sure he would have been
      incapable of mutilating Belknap-Jackson, or even of imprisoning him in a
      goods van of beef. I mean to say, it was merely his way of speaking and
      was not to be taken at all literally.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of his ensuing call upon the pressman, the sheet of the
      following morning contained word of the Honourable George&rsquo;s coming, the
      facts being not garbled more than was usual with this chap.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    RED GAP&rsquo;S NOTABLE GUEST

    En route for our thriving metropolis is a personage no
    less distinguished than the Honourable George Augustus
    Vane-Basingwell, only brother and next in line of
    succession to his lordship the Earl of Brinstead, the
    well-known British peer of London, England. Our noble
    visitor will be the house guest of Senator and Mrs.
    J. K. Floud, at their palatial residence on Ophir Avenue,
    where he will be extensively entertained, particularly by
    our esteemed fellow-townsman, Egbert G. Floud, with whom
    he recently hobnobbed during the latter&rsquo;s stay in Paris,
    France. His advent will doubtless prelude a season of
    unparalleled gayety, particularly as Mr. Egbert Floud
    assures us that the &ldquo;Judge,&rdquo; as he affectionately calls
    him, is &ldquo;sure some mixer.&rdquo; If this be true, the gentleman
    has selected a community where his talent will find ample
    scope, and we bespeak for his lordship a hearty welcome.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FOURTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      I must do Cousin Egbert the justice to say that he showed a due sense of
      his responsibility in meeting the Honourable George. By general consent
      the honour had seemed to fall to him, both the Belknap-Jacksons and Mrs.
      Effie rather timidly conceding his claim that the distinguished guest
      would prefer it so. Indeed, Cousin Egbert had been loudly arrogant in the
      matter, speaking largely of his European intimacy with the &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; until,
      as he confided to me, he &ldquo;had them all bisoned,&rdquo; or, I believe,
      &ldquo;buffaloed&rdquo; is the term he used, referring to the big-game animal that has
      been swept from the American savannahs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events no one further questioned his right to be at the station
      when the Honourable George arrived, and for the first time almost since
      his own homecoming he got himself up with some attention to detail. If
      left to himself I dare say he would have donned frock-coat and top-hat,
      but at my suggestion he chose his smartest lounge-suit, and I took pains
      to see that the minor details of hat, boots, hose, gloves, etc., were
      studiously correct without being at all assertive.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my own part, I was also at some pains with my attire going consciously
      a bit further with details than Cousin Egbert, thinking it best the
      Honourable George should at once observe a change in my bearing and social
      consequence so that nothing in his manner toward me might embarrassingly
      publish our former relations. The stick, gloves, and monocle would achieve
      this for the moment, and once alone I meant to tell him straight that all
      was over between us as master and man, we having passed out of each
      other&rsquo;s lives in that respect. If necessary, I meant to read to him
      certain passages from the so-called &ldquo;Declaration of Independence,&rdquo; and to
      show him the fateful little card I had found, which would acquaint him, I
      made no doubt, with the great change that had come upon me, after which
      our intimacy would rest solely upon the mutual esteem which I knew to
      exist between us. I mean to say, it would never have done for one moment
      at home, but finding ourselves together in this wild and lawless country
      we would neither of us try to resist America, but face each other as one
      equal native to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waiting on the station platform with Cousin Egbert, he confided to the
      loungers there that he was come to meet his friend Judge Basingwell,
      whereat all betrayed a friendly interest, though they were not at all
      persons that mattered, being of the semi-leisured class who each day went
      down, as they put it, &ldquo;to see Number Six go through.&rdquo; There was thus a
      rather tense air of expectancy when the train pulled in. From one of the
      Pullman night coaches emerged the Honourable George, preceded by a
      blackamoor or raccoon bearing bags and bundles, and followed by another
      uniformed raccoon and a white guard, also bearing bags and bundles, and
      all betraying a marked anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      One glance at the Honourable George served to confirm certain fears I had
      suffered regarding his appearance. Topped by a deer-stalking fore-and-aft
      cap in an inferior state of preservation, he wore the jacket of a
      lounge-suit, once possible, doubtless, but now demoded, and a blazered
      golfing waistcoat, striking for its poisonous greens, trousers from an
      outing suit that I myself had discarded after it came to me, and boots of
      an entirely shocking character. Of his cravat I have not the heart to
      speak, but I may mention that all his garments were quite horrid with
      wrinkles and seemed to have been slept in repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert at once rushed forward to greet his guest, while I busied
      myself in receiving the hand-luggage, wishing to have our guest effaced
      from the scene and secluded, with all possible speed. There were three
      battered handbags, two rolls of travelling rugs, a stick-case, a
      dispatch-case, a pair of binoculars, a hat-box, a top-coat, a storm-coat,
      a portfolio of correspondence materials, a camera, a medicine-case, some
      of these lacking either strap or handle. The attendants all emitted hearty
      sighs of relief when these articles had been deposited upon the platform.
      Without being told, I divined that the Honourable George had greatly
      worried them during the long journey with his fretful demands for service,
      and I tipped them handsomely while he was still engaged with Cousin Egbert
      and the latter&rsquo;s station-lounging friends to whom he was being presented.
      At last, observing me, he came forward, but halted on surveying the
      luggage, and screamed hoarsely to the last attendant who was now boarding
      the train. The latter vanished, but reappeared, as the train moved off,
      with two more articles, a vacuum night-flask and a tin of charcoal
      biscuits, the absence of which had been swiftly detected by their owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at that moment that one of the loungers nearby made a peculiar
      observation. &ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; said he to a native beside him, &ldquo;it must take an awful
      lot of trouble to be an Englishman.&rdquo; At the moment this seemed to me to be
      pregnant with meaning, though doubtless it was because I had so long been
      a resident of the North American wilds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the Honourable George approached me and grasped my hand before
      certain details of my attire and, I fancy, a certain change in my bearing,
      attracted his notice. Perhaps it was the single glass. His grasp of my
      hand relaxed and he rubbed his eyes as if dazed from a blow, but I was
      able to carry the situation off quite nicely under cover of the confusion
      attending his many bags and bundles, being helped also at the moment by
      the deeply humiliating discovery of a certain omission from his attire. I
      could not at first believe my eyes and was obliged to look again and
      again, but there could be no doubt about it: the Honourable George was
      wearing a single spat!
    </p>
    <p>
      I cried out at this, pointing, I fancy, in a most undignified manner, so
      terrific had been the shock of it, and what was my amazement to hear him
      say: &ldquo;But I <i>had</i> only one, you silly! How could I wear &lsquo;em both when
      the other was lost in that bally rabbit-hutch they put me in on shipboard?
      No bigger than a parcels-lift!&rdquo; And he had too plainly crossed North
      America in this shocking state! Glad I was then that Belknap-Jackson was
      not present. The others, I dare say, considered it a mere freak of
      fashion. As quickly as I could, I hustled him into the waiting carriage,
      piling his luggage about him to the best advantage and hurrying Cousin
      Egbert after him as rapidly as I could, though the latter, as on the
      occasion of my own arrival, halted our departure long enough to present
      the Honourable George to the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge, shake hands with my friend Eddie Pierce.&rdquo; adding as the ceremony
      was performed, &ldquo;Eddie keeps a good team, any time you want a hack-ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, Judge,&rdquo; remarked the driver cordially. &ldquo;Just call up Main 224, any
      time. Any friend of Sour-dough&rsquo;s can have anything they want night or
      day.&rdquo; Whereupon he climbed to his box and we at last drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Honourable George had continued from the moment of our meeting to
      glance at me in a peculiar, side-long fashion. He seemed fascinated and
      yet unequal to a straight look at me. He was undoubtedly dazed, as I could
      discern from his absent manner of opening the tin of charcoal biscuits and
      munching one. I mean to say, it was too obviously a mere mechanical
      impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he remarked to Cousin Egbert, who was beaming fondly at him, &ldquo;how
      strange it all is! It&rsquo;s quite foreign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fastest-growing little town in the State,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what makes it grow so silly fast?&rdquo; demanded the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enterprise and industries,&rdquo; answered Cousin Egbert loftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to make a dust about,&rdquo; remarked the Honourable George, staring
      glassily at the main business thoroughfare. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen larger towns&mdash;scores
      of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t begun to see this town yet,&rdquo; responded Cousin Egbert loyally,
      and he called to the driver, &ldquo;Has he, Eddie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, he ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said the driver person genially. &ldquo;Wait till he sees the
      new waterworks and the sash-and-blind factory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he one of your gentleman drivers?&rdquo; demanded the Honourable George.
      &ldquo;And why a blind factory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Eddie&rsquo;s good people all right,&rdquo; answered the other, &ldquo;and the factory
      turns out blinds and things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why turn them out?&rdquo; he left this and continued: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like that American
      Johnny in London that drives his own coach to Brighton, yes? Ripping idea!
      Gentleman driver. But I say, you know, I&rsquo;ll sit on the box with him. Pull
      up a bit, old son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To my consternation the driver chap halted, and before I could remonstrate
      the Honourable George had mounted to the box beside him. Thankful I was we
      had left the main street, though in the residence avenue where the change
      was made we attracted far more attention than was desirable. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I
      tell you he was some mixer?&rdquo; demanded Cousin Egbert of me, but I was too
      sickened to make any suitable response. The Honourable George&rsquo;s possession
      of a single spat was now flaunted, as it were, in the face of Red Gap&rsquo;s
      best families.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How foreign it all is!&rdquo; he repeated, turning back to us, yet with only
      his side-glance for me. &ldquo;But the American Johnny in London had a much
      smarter coach than this, and better animals, too. You&rsquo;re not up to his
      class yet, old thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That dish-faced pinto on the off side,&rdquo; remarked the driver, &ldquo;can outrun
      anything in this town for fun, money, or marbles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marbles!&rdquo; called the Honourable George to us; &ldquo;why marbles? Silly things!
      It&rsquo;s all bally strange! And why do your villagers stare so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some little mixer, all right, all right,&rdquo; murmured Cousin Egbert in a
      sort of ecstasy, as we drew up at the Floud home. &ldquo;And yet one of them
      guys back there called him a typical Britisher. You bet I shut him up
      quick&mdash;saying a thing like that about a plumb stranger. I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; mixed
      it with him right there except I thought it was better to have things nice
      and not start something the minute the Judge got here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With all possible speed I hurried the party indoors, for already faces
      were appearing at the windows of neighbouring houses. Mrs. Effie, who met
      us, allowed her glare at Cousin Egbert, I fancy, to affect the cordiality
      of her greeting to the Honourable George; at least she seemed to be quite
      as dazed as he, and there was a moment of constraint before he went on up
      to the room that had been prepared for him. Once safely within the room I
      contrived a moment alone with him and removed his single spat, not too
      gently, I fear, for the nervous strain since his arrival had told upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have reason to be thankful,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that Belknap-Jackson was not
      present to witness this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They cost seven and six,&rdquo; he muttered, regarding the one spat wistfully.
      &ldquo;But why Belknap-Jackson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. C. Belknap-Jackson of Boston and Red Gap,&rdquo; I returned sternly. &ldquo;He
      does himself perfectly. To think he might have seen you in this rowdyish
      state!&rdquo; And I hastened to seek a presentable lounge-suit from his bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is so strange,&rdquo; he muttered again, quite helplessly. &ldquo;And why
      the mural decoration at the edge of the settlement? Why keep one&rsquo;s eye
      upon it? Why should they do such things? I say, it&rsquo;s all quite monstrous,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that indeed he was quite done for with amazement, so I ran him a
      bath and procured him a dish of tea. He rambled oddly at moments of things
      the guard on the night-coach had told him of North America, of Niagara
      Falls, and Missouri and other objects of interest. He was still almost
      quite a bit dotty when I was obliged to leave him for an appointment with
      the raccoon and his wife to discuss the menu of my opening dinner, but
      Cousin Egbert, who had rejoined us, was listening sympathetically. As I
      left, the two were pegging it from a bottle of hunting sherry which the
      Honourable George had carried in his dispatch-case. I was about to warn
      him that he would come out spotted, but instantly I saw that there must be
      an end to such surveillance. I could not manage an enterprise of the
      magnitude of the United States Grill and yet have an eye to his meat and
      drink. I resolved to let spots come as they would.
    </p>
    <p>
      On all hands I was now congratulated by members of the North Side set upon
      the master-stroke I had played in adding the Honourable George to their
      number. Not only did it promise to reunite certain warring factions in the
      North Side set itself, but it truly bade fair to disintegrate the Bohemian
      set. Belknap-Jackson wrung my hand that afternoon, begging me to inform
      the Honourable George that he would call on the morrow to pay his
      respects. Mrs. Judge Ballard besought me to engage him for an early
      dinner, and Mrs. Effie, it is needless to say, after recovering from the
      shock of his arrival, which she attributed to Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s want of
      taste, thanked me with a wealth of genuine emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only by slight degrees, then, did it fall to be noticed that the
      Honourable George did not hold himself to be too strictly bound by our
      social conventions as to whom one should be pally with. Thus, on the
      morrow, at the hour when the Belknap-Jacksons called, he was regrettably
      absent on what Cousin Egbert called &ldquo;a hack-ride&rdquo; with the driver person
      he had met the day before, nor did they return until after the callers had
      waited the better part of two hours. Cousin Egbert, as usual, received the
      blame for this, yet neither of the Belknap-Jacksons nor Mrs. Effie dared
      to upbraid him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being presented to the callers, I am bound to say that the Honourable
      George showed himself to be immensely impressed by Belknap-Jackson, whom I
      had never beheld more perfectly vogue in all his appointments. He became,
      in fact, rather moody in the presence of this subtle niceness of detail,
      being made conscious, I dare say, of his own sloppy lounge-suit, rumpled
      cravat, and shocking boots, and despite Belknap-Jackson&rsquo;s amiable efforts
      to draw him into talk about hunting in the shires and our county society
      at home, I began to fear that they would not hit it off together. The
      Honourable George did, however, consent to drive with his caller the
      following day, and I relied upon the tandem to recall him to his better
      self. But when the callers had departed he became quite almost plaintive
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, you know, I shan&rsquo;t be wanted to pal up much with that chap, shall
      I? I mean to say, he wears so many clothes. They make me writhe as if I
      wore them myself. It won&rsquo;t do, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him very firmly that this was piffle of the most wretched sort.
      That his caller wore but the prescribed number of garments, each vogue to
      the last note, and that he was a person whom one must know. He responded
      pettishly that he vastly preferred the gentleman driver with whom he had
      spent the afternoon, and &ldquo;Sour-dough,&rdquo; as he was now calling Cousin
      Egbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jolly chaps, with no swank,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;We drove quite almost
      everywhere&mdash;waterworks, cemetery, sash-and-blind factory. You know I
      thought &lsquo;blind factory&rsquo; was some of their bally American slang for the
      shop of a chap who made eyeglasses and that sort of thing, but nothing of
      the kind. They saw up timbers there quite all over the place and nail them
      up again into articles. It&rsquo;s all quite foreign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nor was his account of his drive with Belknap-Jackson the following day a
      bit more reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t stop again at the sash-and-blind factory, where I wished to
      see the timbers being sawed and nailed, but drove me to a country club
      which was not in the country and wasn&rsquo;t a club; not a human there, not
      even a barman. Fancy a club of that sort! But he took me to his own house
      for a glass of sherry and a biscuit, and there it wasn&rsquo;t so rotten. Rather
      a mother-in-law I think, she is&mdash;bally old booming grenadier&mdash;topping
      sort&mdash;no end of fun. We palled up immensely and I quite forgot the
      Jackson chap till it was time for him to drive me back to these diggings.
      Rather sulky he was, I fancy; uppish sort. Told him the old one was quite
      like old Caroline, dowager duchess of Clewe, but couldn&rsquo;t tell if it
      pleased him. Seemed to like it and seemed not to: rather uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asked him why the people of the settlement pronounced his name &lsquo;Belknap
      Hyphen Jackson,&rsquo; and that seemed to make him snarky again. I mean to say
      names with hyphen marks in &lsquo;em&mdash;I&rsquo;d never heard the hyphen pronounced
      before, but everything is so strange. He said only the lowest classes did
      it as a form of coarse wit, and that he was wasting himself here. Wouldn&rsquo;t
      stay another day if it were not for family reasons. Queer sort of wheeze
      to say &lsquo;hyphen&rsquo; in a chap&rsquo;s name as if it were a word, when it wasn&rsquo;t at
      all. The old girl, though&mdash;bellower she is&mdash;perfectly top-hole;
      familiar with cattle&mdash;all that sort of thing. Sent away the chap&rsquo;s
      sherry and had &lsquo;em bring whiskey and soda. The hyphen chap fidgeted a good
      bit&mdash;nervous sort, I take it. Looked through a score of magazines, I
      dare say, when he found we didn&rsquo;t notice him much; turned the leaves too
      fast to see anything, though; made noises and coughed&mdash;that sort of
      thing. Fine old girl. Daughter, hyphen chap&rsquo;s wife, tried to talk, too,
      some rot about the season being well on here, and was there a good deal of
      society in London, and would I be free for dinner on the ninth?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly chatter! old girl talked sense: cattle, mines, timber, blind
      factory, two-year olds, that kind of thing. Shall see her often. Not the
      hyphen chap, though; too much like one of those Bond Street milliner-chap
      managers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vague misgivings here beset me as to the value of the Honourable George to
      the North Side set. Nor could I feel at all reassured on the following day
      when Mrs. Effie held an afternoon reception in his honour. That he should
      be unaware of the event&rsquo;s importance was to be expected, for as yet I had
      been unable to get him to take the Red Gap social crisis seriously. At the
      hour when he should have been dressed and ready I found him playing at
      cribbage with Cousin Egbert in the latter&rsquo;s apartment, and to my dismay he
      insisted upon finishing the rubber although guests were already arriving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when the game was done he flatly refused to dress suitably, declaring
      that his lounge-suit should be entirely acceptable to these rough frontier
      people, and he consented to go down at all only on condition that Cousin
      Egbert would accompany him. Thereafter for an hour the two of them drank
      tea uncomfortably as often as it was given them, and while the Honourable
      George undoubtedly made his impression, I could not but regret that he had
      so few conversational graces.
    </p>
    <p>
      How different, I reflected, had been my own entrée into this county
      society! As well as I might I again carried off the day for the Honourable
      George, endeavouring from time to time to put him at his ease, yet he
      breathed an unfeigned sigh of relief when the last guest had left and he
      could resume his cribbage with Cousin Egbert. But he had received one
      impression of which I was glad: an impression of my own altered social
      quality, for I had graced the occasion with an urbanity which was as far
      beyond him as it must have been astonishing. It was now that he began to
      take seriously what I had told him of my business enterprise, so many of
      the guests having mentioned it to him in terms of the utmost enthusiasm.
      After my first accounts to him he had persisted in referring to it as a
      tuck-shop, a sort of place where schoolboys would exchange their halfpence
      for toffy, sweet-cakes, and marbles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he demanded to be shown the premises and was at once duly impressed
      both with their quiet elegance and my own business acumen. How it had all
      come about, and why I should be addressed as &ldquo;Colonel Ruggles&rdquo; and treated
      as a person of some importance in the community, I dare say he has never
      comprehended to this day. As I had planned to do, I later endeavoured to
      explain to him that in North America persons were almost quite equal to
      one another&mdash;being born so&mdash;but at this he told me not to be
      silly and continued to regard my rise as an insoluble part of the
      strangeness he everywhere encountered, even after I added that Demosthenes
      was the son of a cutler, that Cardinal Wolsey&rsquo;s father had been a pork
      butcher, and that Garfield had worked on a canal-boat. I found him quite
      hopeless. &ldquo;Chaps go dotty talkin&rsquo; that piffle,&rdquo; was his comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At another time, I dare say, I should have been rather distressed over
      this inability of the Honourable George to comprehend and adapt himself to
      the peculiarities of American life as readily as I had done, but just now
      I was quite too taken up with the details of my opening to give it the
      deeper consideration it deserved. In fact, there were moments when I
      confessed to myself that I did not care tuppence about it, such was the
      strain upon my executive faculties. When decorators and furnishers had
      done their work, when the choice carpet was laid, when the kitchen and
      table equipments were completed to the last detail, and when the lighting
      was artistically correct, there was still the matter of service.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to this, I conceived and carried out what I fancy was rather a
      brilliant stroke, which was nothing less than to eliminate the fellow
      Hobbs as a social factor of even the Bohemian set. In contracting with him
      for my bread and rolls, I took an early opportunity of setting the chap in
      his place, as indeed it was not difficult to do when he had observed the
      splendid scale on which I was operating. At our second interview he was
      removing his hat and addressing me as &ldquo;sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I have found that I can quite gracefully place myself on a level
      with the middle-class American, there is a serving type of our own people
      to which I shall eternally feel superior; the Hobbs fellow was of this
      sort, having undeniably the soul of a lackey. In addition to jobbing his
      bread and rolls, I engaged him as pantry man, and took on such members of
      his numerous family as were competent. His wife was to assist my raccoon
      cook in the kitchen, three of his sons were to serve as waiters, and his
      youngest, a lad in his teens, I installed as vestiare, garbing him in a
      smart uniform and posting him to relieve my gentleman patrons of their
      hats and top-coats. A daughter was similarly installed as maid, and the
      two achieved an effect of smartness unprecedented in Red Gap, an effect to
      which I am glad to say that the community responded instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other establishments it was the custom for patrons to hang their
      garments on hat-pegs, often under a printed warning that the proprietor
      would disclaim responsibility in case of loss. In the one known as &ldquo;Bert&rsquo;s
      Place&rdquo; indeed the warning was positively vulgar: &ldquo;Watch Your Overcoat.&rdquo; Of
      course that sort of coarseness would have been impossible in my own place.
    </p>
    <p>
      As another important detail I had taken over from Mrs. Judson her stock of
      jellies and compotes which I had found to be of a most excellent
      character, and had ordered as much more as she could manage to produce,
      together with cut flowers from her garden for my tables. She, herself,
      being a young woman of the most pleasing capabilities, had done a bit of
      charring for me and was now to be in charge of the glassware, linen, and
      silver. I had found her, indeed, highly sympathetic with my highest aims,
      and not a few of her suggestions as to management proved to be entirely
      sound. Her unspeakable dog continued his quite objectionable advances to
      me at every opportunity, in spite of my hitting him about, rather, when I
      could do so unobserved, but the sinister interpretation that might be
      placed upon this by the baser-minded was now happily answered by the
      circumstance of her being in my employment. Her child, I regret to say,
      was still grossly overfed, seldom having its face free from jam or other
      smears. It persisted, moreover, in twisting my name into &ldquo;Ruggums,&rdquo; which
      I found not a little embarrassing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night of my opening found me calmly awaiting the triumph that was due
      me. As some one has said of Napoleon, I had won my battle in my tent
      before the firing of a single shot. I mean to say, I had looked so
      conscientiously after details, even to assuring myself that Cousin Egbert
      and the Honourable George would appear in evening dress, my last act
      having been to coerce each of them into purchasing varnished boots, the
      former submitting meekly enough, though the Honourable George insisted it
      was a silly fuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock, having devoted a final inspection to the kitchen where
      the female raccoon was well on with the dinner, and having noted that the
      members of my staff were in their places, I gave a last pleased survey of
      my dining-room, with its smartly equipped tables, flower-bedecked,
      gleaming in the softened light from my shaded candlesticks. Truly it was a
      scene of refined elegance such as Red Gap had never before witnessed
      within its own confines, and I had seen to it that the dinner as well
      would mark an epoch in the lives of these simple but worthy people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a heavy nor a cloying repast would they find. Indeed, the bare
      simplicity of my menu, had it been previously disclosed, would doubtless
      have disappointed more than one of my dinner-giving patronesses; but each
      item had been perfected to an extent never achieved by them. Their
      weakness had ever been to serve a profusion of neutral dishes, pleasing
      enough to the eye, but unedifying except as a spectacle. I mean to say, as
      food it was noncommittal; it failed to intrigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should serve only a thin soup, a fish, small birds, two vegetables, a
      salad, a sweet and a savoury, but each item would prove worthy of the
      profoundest consideration. In the matter of thin soup, for example, the
      local practice was to serve a fluid of which, beyond the circumstance that
      it was warmish and slightly tinted, nothing of interest could ever be
      ascertained. My own thin soup would be a revelation to them. Again, in the
      matter of fish. This course with the hostesses of Red Gap had seemed to be
      merely an excuse for a pause. I had truly sympathized with Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s
      bitter complaint: &ldquo;They hand you a dab of something about the size of a
      watch-charm with two strings of potato.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time, then, the fish course in Red Gap was to be an event,
      an abundant portion of native fish with a lobster sauce which I had
      carried out to its highest power. My birds, hot from the oven, would be
      food in the strictest sense of the word, my vegetables cooked with a
      zealous attention, and my sweet immensely appealing without being
      pretentiously spectacular. And for what I believed to be quite the first
      time in the town, good coffee would be served. Disheartening, indeed, had
      been the various attenuations of coffee which had been imposed upon me in
      my brief career as a diner-out among these people. Not one among them had
      possessed the genius to master an acceptable decoction of the berry, the
      bald simplicity of the correct formula being doubtless incredible to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blare of a motor horn aroused me from this musing, and from that
      moment I had little time for meditation until the evening, as the <i>Journal</i>
      recorded the next morning, &ldquo;had gone down into history.&rdquo; My patrons
      arrived in groups, couples, or singly, almost faster than I could seat
      them. The Hobbs lad, as vestiare, would halt them for hats and wraps,
      during which pause they would emit subdued cries of surprise and delight
      at my beautifully toned ensemble, after which, as they walked to their
      tables, it was not difficult to see that they were properly impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Effie, escorted by the Honourable George and cousin Egbert, was among
      the early arrivals; the Senator being absent from town at a sitting of the
      House. These were quickly followed by the Belknap-Jacksons and the Mixer,
      resplendent in purple satin and diamonds, all being at one of my large
      tables, so that the Honourable George sat between Mrs. Belknap-Jackson and
      Mrs. Effie, though he at first made a somewhat undignified essay to seat
      himself next the Mixer. Needless to say, all were in evening dress, though
      the Honourable George had fumbled grossly with his cravat and rumpled his
      shirt, nor had he submitted to having his beard trimmed, as I had warned
      him to do. As for Belknap-Jackson, I had never beheld him more truly vogue
      in every detail, and his slightly austere manner in any Red Gap gathering
      had never set him better. Both Mrs. Belknap-Jackson and Mrs. Effie wielded
      their lorgnons upon the later comers, thus giving their table quite an
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Judge Ballard, who had come to be one of my staunchest adherents,
      occupied an adjacent table with her family party and two or three of the
      younger dancing set. The Indian Tuttle with his wife and two daughters
      were also among the early comers, and I could not but marvel anew at the
      red man&rsquo;s histrionic powers. In almost quite correct evening attire, and
      entirely decorous in speech and gesture, he might readily have been
      thought some one that mattered, had he not at an early opportunity caught
      my eye and winked with a sly significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite almost every one of the North Side set was present, imparting to my
      room a general air of distinguished smartness, and in addition there were
      not a few of what Belknap-Jackson had called the &ldquo;rabble,&rdquo; persons of no
      social value, to be sure, but honest, well-mannered folk, small tradesmen,
      shop-assistants, and the like. These plain people, I may say, I took
      especial pains to welcome and put at their ease, for I had resolved, in
      effect, to be one of them, after the manner prescribed by their
      Declaration thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      With quite all of them I chatted easily a moment or two, expressing the
      hope that they would be well pleased with their entertainment. I noted
      while thus engaged that Belknap-Jackson eyed me with frank and superior
      cynicism, but this affected me quite not at all and I took pains to point
      my indifference, chatting with increased urbanity with the two
      cow-persons, Hank and Buck, who had entered rather uncertainly, not in
      evening dress, to be sure, but in decent black as befitted their stations.
      When I had prevailed upon them to surrender their hats to the vestiare and
      had seated them at a table for two, they informed me in hoarse undertones
      that they were prepared to &ldquo;put a bet down on every card from soda to
      hock,&rdquo; so that I at first suspected they had thought me conducting a
      gaming establishment, but ultimately gathered that they were merely
      expressing a cordial determination to enter into the spirit of the
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There then entered, somewhat to my uneasiness, the Klondike woman and her
      party. Being almost the last, it will be understood that they created no
      little sensation as she led them down the thronged room to her table. She
      was wearing an evening gown of lustrous black with the apparently simple
      lines that are so baffling to any but the expert maker, with a black
      picture hat that suited her no end. I saw more than one matron of the
      North Side set stiffen in her seat, while Mrs. Belknap-Jackson and Mrs.
      Effie turned upon her the chilling broadside of their lorgnons.
      Belknap-Jackson merely drew himself up austerely. The three other women of
      her party, flutterers rather, did little but set off their hostess. The
      four men were of a youngish sort, chaps in banks, chemists&rsquo; assistants,
      that sort of thing, who were constantly to be seen in her train. They were
      especially reprobated by the matrons of the correct set by reason of their
      deliberately choosing to ally themselves with the Bohemian set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acutely feeling the antagonism aroused by this group, I was momentarily
      discouraged in a design I had half formed of using my undoubted influence
      to unite the warring social factions of Red Gap, even as Bismarck had once
      brought the warring Prussian states together in a federated Germany. I
      began to see that the Klondike woman would forever prove unacceptable to
      the North Side set. The cliques would unite against her, even if one
      should find in her a spirit of reconciliation, which I supremely doubted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bustle having in a measure subsided, I gave orders for the soup to be
      served, at the same time turning the current into the electric pianoforte.
      I had wished for this opening number something attractive yet dignified,
      which would in a manner of speaking symbolize an occasion to me at least
      highly momentous. To this end I had chosen Handel&rsquo;s celebrated Largo, and
      at the first strains of this highly meritorious composition I knew that I
      had chosen surely. I am sure the piece was indelibly engraved upon the
      minds of those many dinner-givers who were for the first time in their
      lives realizing that a thin soup may be made a thing to take seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nominally, I occupied a seat at the table with the Belknap-Jacksons and
      Mrs. Effie, though I apprehended having to be more or less up and down in
      the direction of my staff. Having now seated myself to soup, I was for the
      first time made aware of the curious behaviour of the Honourable George.
      Disregarding his own soup, which was of itself unusual with him, he was
      staring straight ahead with a curious intensity. A half turn of my head
      was enough. He sat facing the Klondike woman. As I again turned a bit I
      saw that under cover of her animated converse with her table companions
      she was at intervals allowing her very effective eyes to rest, as if
      absently, upon him. I may say now that a curious chill seized me, bringing
      with it a sudden psychic warning that all was not going to be as it should
      be. Some calamity impended. The man was quite apparently fascinated,
      staring with a fixed, hypnotic intensity that had already been noted by
      his companions on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a word about the soup, shot quickly and directly at him, I managed to
      divert his gaze, but his eyes had returned even before the spoon had gone
      once to his lips. The second time there was a soup stain upon his already
      rumpled shirt front. Presently it became only too horribly certain that
      the man was out of himself, for when the fish course was served he
      remained serenely unconscious that none of the lobster sauce accompanied
      his own portion. It was a rich sauce, and the almost immediate effect of
      shell-fish upon his complexion being only too well known to me, I had
      directed that his fish should be served without it, though I had fully
      expected him to row me for it and perhaps create a scene. The circumstance
      of his blindly attacking the unsauced fish was eloquent indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Belknap-Jacksons and Mrs. Effie were now plainly alarmed, and somewhat
      feverishly sought to engage his attention, with the result only that he
      snapped monosyllables at them without removing his gaze from its mark. And
      the woman was now too obviously pluming herself upon the effect she had
      achieved; upon us all she flashed an amused consciousness of her power,
      yet with a fine affectation of quite ignoring us. I was here obliged to
      leave the table to oversee the serving of the wine, returning after an
      interval to find the situation unchanged, save that the woman no longer
      glanced at the Honourable George. Such were her tactics. Having enmeshed
      him, she confidently left him to complete his own undoing. I had returned
      with the serving of the small birds. Observing his own before him, the
      Honourable George wished to be told why he had not been served with fish,
      and only with difficulty could be convinced that he had partaken of this.
      &ldquo;Of course in public places one must expect to come into contact with
      persons of that sort,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something should be done about it,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Belknap-Jackson, and
      they both murmured &ldquo;Creature!&rdquo; though it was plain that the Honourable
      George had little notion to whom they referred. Observing, however, that
      the woman no longer glanced at him, he fell to his bird somewhat
      whole-heartedly, as indeed did all my guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      From every side I could hear eager approval of the repast which was now
      being supplemented at most of the tables by a sound wine of the Burgundy
      type which I had recommended or by a dry champagne. Meantime, the electric
      pianoforte played steadily through a repertoire that had progressed from
      the Largo to more vivacious pieces of the American folkdance school. As
      was said in the press the following day, &ldquo;Gayety and good-feeling reigned
      supreme, and one and all felt that it was indeed good to be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the sweet and the savoury the dinner progressed, the latter
      proving to be a novelty that the hostesses of Red Gap thereafter slavishly
      copied, and with the advent of the coffee ensued a noticeable relaxation.
      People began to visit one another&rsquo;s tables and there was a blithe
      undercurrent of praise for my efforts to smarten the town&rsquo;s public dining.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Klondike woman, I fancy, was the first to light a cigarette, though
      quickly followed by the ladies of her party. Mrs. Belknap-Jackson and Mrs.
      Effie, after a period of futile glaring at her through the lorgnons,
      seemed to make their resolves simultaneously, and forthwith themselves
      lighted cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s done in the smart English restaurants,&rdquo; murmured
      Belknap-Jackson as he assisted the ladies to their lights. Thereupon Mrs.
      Judge Ballard, farther down the room, began to smoke what I believe was
      her first cigarette, which proved to be a signal for other ladies of the
      Onwards and Upwards Society to do the same, Mrs. Ballard being their
      president. It occurred to me that these ladies were grimly bent on showing
      the Klondike woman that they could trifle quite as gracefully as she with
      the lesser vices of Bohemia; or perhaps they wished to demonstrate to the
      younger dancing men in her train that the North Side set was not
      desolately austere in its recreation. The Honourable George, I regret to
      say, produced a smelly pipe which he would have lighted; but at a shocked
      and cold glance from me he put it by and allowed the Mixer to roll him one
      of the yellow paper cigarettes from a sack of tobacco which she had
      produced from some secret recess of her costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert had been excitedly happy throughout the meal and now paid me
      a quaint compliment upon the food. &ldquo;Some eats, Bill!&rdquo; he called to me. &ldquo;I
      got to hand it to you,&rdquo; though what precisely it was he wished to hand me
      I never ascertained, for the Mixer at that moment claimed my attention
      with a compliment of her own. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;is the only dinner I&rsquo;ve
      eaten for a long time that was composed entirely of food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This hour succeeding the repast I found quite entirely agreeable, more
      than one person that mattered assuring me that I had assisted Red Gap to a
      notable advance in the finest and correctest sense of the word, and it was
      with a very definite regret that I beheld my guests departing. Returning
      to our table from a group of these who had called me to make their adieus,
      I saw that a most regrettable incident had occurred&mdash;nothing less
      than the formal presentation of the Honourable George to the Klondike
      woman. And the Mixer had appallingly done it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is so strange here,&rdquo; I heard him saying as I passed their
      table, and the woman echoed, &ldquo;Everything!&rdquo; while her glance enveloped him
      with a curious effect of appraisal. The others of her party were making
      much of him, I could see, quite as if they had preposterous designs of
      wresting him from the North Side set to be one of themselves. Mrs.
      Belknap-Jackson and Mrs. Effie affected to ignore the meeting.
      Belknap-Jackson stared into vacancy with a quite shocked expression as if
      vandals had desecrated an altar in his presence. Cousin Egbert having
      drawn off one of his newly purchased boots during the dinner was now
      replacing it with audible groans, but I caught his joyous comment a moment
      later: &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you the Judge was some mixer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mixing, indeed,&rdquo; snapped the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour later the historic evening had come to an end. The last guest
      had departed, and all of my staff, save Mrs. Judson and her male child.
      These I begged to escort to their home, since the way was rather far and
      dark. The child, incautiously left in the kitchen at the mercy of the
      female black, had with criminal stupidity been stuffed with food, traces
      of almost every course of the dinner being apparent upon its puffy
      countenance. Being now in a stupor from overfeeding, I was obliged to lug
      the thing over my shoulder. I resolved to warn the mother at an early
      opportunity of the perils of an unrestricted diet, although the deluded
      creature seemed actually to glory in its corpulence. I discovered when
      halfway to her residence that the thing was still tightly clutching the
      gnawed thigh-bone of a fowl which was spotting the shoulder of my smartest
      top-coat. The mother, however, was so ingenuously delighted with my
      success and so full of prattle concerning my future triumphs that I
      forbore to instruct her at this time. I may say that of all my staff she
      had betrayed the most intelligent understanding of my ideals, and I bade
      her good-night with a strong conviction that she would greatly assist me
      in the future. She also promised that Mr. Barker should thereafter be
      locked in a cellar at such times as she was serving me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning through the town, I heard strains of music from the
      establishment known as &ldquo;Bert&rsquo;s Place,&rdquo; and was shocked on staring through
      his show window to observe the Honourable George and Cousin Egbert
      waltzing madly with the cow-persons, Hank and Buck, to the strains of a
      mechanical piano. The Honourable George had exchanged his top-hat for his
      partner&rsquo;s cow-person hat, which came down over his ears in a most
      regrettable manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it best not to intrude upon their coarse amusement and went on
      to the grill to see that all was safe for the night. Returning from my
      inspection some half-hour later, I came upon the two, Cousin Egbert in the
      lead, the Honourable George behind him. They greeted me somewhat
      boisterously, but I saw that they were now content to return home and to
      bed. As they walked somewhat mincingly, I noticed that they were in their
      hose, carrying their varnished boots in either hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the Honourable George, who still wore the cow-person&rsquo;s hat, I began now
      to have the gravest doubts. There had been an evil light in the eyes of
      the Klondike woman and her Bohemian cohorts as they surveyed him. As he
      preceded me I heard him murmur ecstatically: &ldquo;Sush is life.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FIFTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Launched now upon a business venture that would require my unremitting
      attention if it were to prosper, it may be imagined that I had little
      leisure for the social vagaries of the Honourable George, shocking as
      these might be to one&rsquo;s finer tastes. And yet on the following morning I
      found time to tell him what. To put it quite bluntly, I gave him beans for
      his loose behaviour the previous evening, in publicly ogling and meeting
      as an equal one whom one didn&rsquo;t know.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my amazement, instead of being heartily ashamed of his licentiousness,
      I found him recalcitrant. Stubborn as a mule he was and with a low animal
      cunning that I had never given him credit for. &ldquo;Demosthenes was the son of
      a cutler,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and Napoleon worked on a canal-boat, what? Didn&rsquo;t you
      say so yourself, you juggins, what? Fancy there being upper and lower
      classes among natives! What rot! And I like North America. I don&rsquo;t mind
      telling you straight I&rsquo;m going to take it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horrified by these reckless words, I could only say &ldquo;Noblesse oblige,&rdquo;
       meaning to convey that whatever the North Americans did, the next Earl of
      Brinstead must not meet persons one doesn&rsquo;t know, whereat he rejoined
      tartly that I was &ldquo;to stow that piffle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being now quite alarmed, I took the further time to call upon
      Belknap-Jackson, believing that he, if any one, could recall the
      Honourable George to his better nature. He, too, was shocked, as I had
      been, and at first would have put the blame entirely upon the shoulders of
      Cousin Egbert, but at this I was obliged to admit that the Honourable
      George had too often shown a regrettable fondness for the society of
      persons that did not matter, especially females, and I cited the case of
      the typing-girl and the Brixton millinery person, with either of whom he
      would have allied himself in marriage had not his lordship intervened.
      Belknap-Jackson was quite properly horrified at these revelations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he no sense of &lsquo;Noblesse oblige&rsquo;?&rdquo; he demanded, at which I quoted the
      result of my own use of this phrase to the unfortunate man. Quite too
      plain it was that &ldquo;Noblesse oblige!&rdquo; would never stop him from yielding to
      his baser impulses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be tactful, then,&rdquo; remarked Belknap-Jackson. &ldquo;Without appearing
      to oppose him we must yet show him who is really who in Red Gap. We shall
      let him see that we have standards which must be as rigidly adhered to as
      those of an older civilization. I fancy it can be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Privately I fancied not, yet I forbore to say this or to prolong the
      painful interview, particularly as I was due at the United States Grill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Recorder</i> of that morning had done me handsomely, declaring my
      opening to have been a social event long to be remembered, and describing
      the costumes of a dozen or more of the smartly gowned matrons, quite as if
      it had been an assembly ball. My task now was to see that the Grill was
      kept to the high level of its opening, both as a social ganglion, if one
      may use the term, and as a place to which the public would ever turn for
      food that mattered. For my first luncheon the raccoons had prepared, under
      my direction, a steak-and-kidney pie, in addition to which I offered a
      thick soup and a pudding of high nutritive value.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my pleased astonishment the crowd at midday was quite all that my staff
      could serve, several of the Hobbs brood being at school, and the luncheon
      was received with every sign of approval by the business persons who sat
      to it. Not only were there drapers, chemists, and shop-assistants, but
      solicitors and barristers, bankers and estate agents, and all quite eager
      with their praise of my fare. To each of these I explained that I should
      give them but few things, but that these would be food in the finest sense
      of the word, adding that the fault of the American school lay in
      attempting a too-great profusion of dishes, none of which in consequence
      could be raised to its highest power.
    </p>
    <p>
      So sound was my theory and so nicely did my simple-dished luncheon
      demonstrate it that I was engaged on the spot to provide the bi-monthly
      banquet of the Chamber of Commerce, the president of which rather
      seriously proposed that it now be made a monthly affair, since they would
      no longer be at the mercy of a hotel caterer whose ambition ran inversely
      to his skill. Indeed, after the pudding, I was this day asked to become a
      member of the body, and I now felt that I was indubitably one of them&mdash;America
      and I had taken each other as seriously as could be desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once during the afternoon I wondered rather painfully what the
      Honourable George might be doing. I knew that he had been promised to a
      meeting of the Onwards and Upwards Club through the influence of Mrs.
      Effie, where it had been hoped that he would give a talk on Country Life
      in England. At least she had hinted to them that he might do this, though
      I had known from the beginning that he would do nothing of the sort, and
      had merely hoped that he would appear for a dish of tea and stay quiet,
      which was as much as the North Side set could expect of him. Induced to
      speak, I was quite certain he would tell them straight that Country Life
      in England was silly rot, and that was all to it. Now, not having seen him
      during the day, I could but hope that he had attended the gathering in
      suitable afternoon attire, and that he would have divined that the
      cattle-person&rsquo;s hat did not coordinate with this.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four-thirty, while I was still concerned over the possible
      misadventures of the Honourable George, my first patrons for tea began to
      arrive, for I had let it be known that I should specialize in this.
      Toasted crumpets there were, and muffins, and a tea cake rich with plums,
      and tea, I need not say, which was all that tea could be. Several tables
      were filled with prominent ladies of the North Side set, who were loud in
      their exclamations of delight, especially at the finished smartness of my
      service, for it was perhaps now that the profoundly serious thought I had
      given to my silver, linen, and glassware showed to best advantage. I
      suspect that this was the first time many of my guests had encountered a
      tea cozy, since from that day they began to be prevalent in Red Gap homes.
      Also my wagon containing the crumpets, muffins, tea cake, jam and
      bread-and-butter, which I now used for the first time created a veritable
      sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an agreeable hum of chatter from these early comers when I found
      myself welcoming Mrs. Judge Ballard and half a dozen members of the
      Onwards and Upwards Club, all of them wearing what I made out to be a
      baffled look. From these I presently managed to gather that their guest of
      honour for the afternoon had simply not appeared, and that the meeting,
      after awaiting him for two hours, had dissolved in some resentment, the
      time having been spent chiefly in an unflattering dissection of the
      Klondike woman&rsquo;s behaviour the evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a naughty man to disappoint us so cruelly!&rdquo; declared Mrs. Judge
      Ballard of the Honourable George, but the coquetry of it was feigned to
      cover a very real irritation. I made haste with possible excuses. I said
      that he might be ill, or that important letters in that day&rsquo;s post might
      have detained him. I knew he had been astonishingly well that morning,
      also that he loathed letters and almost practically never received any;
      but something had to be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A naughty, naughty fellow!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Ballard, and the members of her
      party echoed it. They had looked forward rather pathetically, I saw, to
      hearing about Country Life in England from one who had lived it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was now drawn to greet the Belknap-Jacksons, who entered, and to the
      pleasure of winning their hearty approval for the perfection of my
      arrangements. As the wife presently joined Mrs. Ballard&rsquo;s group, the
      husband called me to his table and disclosed that almost the worst might
      be feared of the Honourable George. He was at that moment, it appeared,
      with a rabble of cow-persons and members of the lower class gathered at a
      stockade at the edge of town, where various native horses fresh from the
      wilderness were being taught to be ridden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wretched Floud is with him,&rdquo; continued my informant, &ldquo;also the Tuttle
      chap, who continues to be received by our best people in spite of my
      remonstrances, and he yells quite like a demon when one of the riders is
      thrown. I passed as quickly as I could. The spectacle was&mdash;of course
      I make allowances for Vane-Basingwell&rsquo;s ignorance of our standards&mdash;it
      was nothing short of disgusting; a man of his position consorting with the
      herd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me no longer ago than this morning,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that he was going
      to take up America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He <i>has</i>!&rdquo; said Belknap-Jackson with bitter emphasis. &ldquo;You should
      see what he has on&mdash;a cowboy hat and chapps! And the very lowest of
      them are calling him &lsquo;Judge&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He flunked a meeting of the Onwards and Upwards Society,&rdquo; I added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know! I know! And who could have expected it in one of his lineage? At
      this very moment he should be conducting himself as one of his class. Can
      you wonder at my impatience with the West? Here at an hour when our social
      life should be in evidence, when all trade should be forgotten, I am the
      only man in the town who shows himself in a tea-room; and Vane-Basingwell
      over there debasing himself with our commonest sort!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All at once I saw that I myself must bear the brunt of this scandal. I had
      brought hither the Honourable George, promising a personage who would for
      once and all unify the North Side set and perhaps disintegrate its rival.
      I had been felicitated upon my master-stroke. And now it seemed I had come
      a cropper. But I resolved not to give up, and said as much now to
      Belknap-Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be blamed for bringing him among you, but trust me if things are
      really as bad as they seem, I&rsquo;ll get him off again. I&rsquo;ll not let myself be
      bowled by such a silly lob as that. Trust me to devote profound thought to
      this problem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all have every confidence in you,&rdquo; he assured me, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t be too
      severe all at once with the chap. He might recover a sane balance even
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall use discretion,&rdquo; I assured him, &ldquo;but if it proves that I have
      fluffed my catch, rely upon me to use extreme measures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red Gap needs your best effort,&rdquo; he replied in a voice that brimmed with
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five-thirty, my rush being over, I repaired to the neighbourhood where
      the Honourable George had been reported. The stockade now contained only a
      half-score of the untaught horses, but across the road from it was a
      public house, or saloon, from which came unmistakable sounds of carousing.
      It was an unsavoury place, frequented only by cattle and horse persons,
      the proprietor being an abandoned character named Spilmer, who had once
      done a patron to death in a drunken quarrel. Only slight legal
      difficulties had been made for him, however, it having been pleaded that
      he acted in self-defence, and the creature had at once resumed his trade
      as publican. There was even public sympathy for him at the time on the
      ground that he possessed a blind mother, though I have never been able to
      see that this should have been a factor in adjudging him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I paused now before the low place, imagining I could detect the tones of
      the Honourable George high above the chorus that came out to me. Deciding
      that in any event it would not become me to enter a resort of this stamp,
      I walked slowly back toward the more reputable part of town, and was
      presently rewarded by seeing the crowd emerge. It was led, I saw, by the
      Honourable George. The cattle-hat was still down upon his ears, and to my
      horror he had come upon the public thoroughfare with his legs encased in
      the chapps&mdash;a species of leathern pantalettes covered with goat&rsquo;s
      wool&mdash;a garment which I need not say no gentleman should be seen
      abroad in. As worn by the cow-persons in their daily toil they are only
      just possible, being as far from true vogue as anything well could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accompanying him were Cousin Egbert, the Indian Tuttle, the cow-persons,
      Hank and Buck, and three or four others of the same rough stamp.
      Unobtrusively I followed them to our main thoroughfare, deeply humiliated
      by the atrocious spectacle the Honourable George was making of himself,
      only to observe them turn into another public house entitled &ldquo;The Family
      Liquor Store,&rdquo; where it seemed only too certain, since the bearing of all
      was highly animated, that they would again carouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once seeing my duty, I boldly entered, finding them aligned against the
      American bar and clamouring for drink. My welcome was heartfelt, even
      enthusiastic, almost every one of them beginning to regale me with
      incidents of the afternoon&rsquo;s horse-breaking. The Honourable George, it
      seemed, had himself briefly mounted one of the animals, having fallen into
      the belief that the cow-persons did not try earnestly enough to stay on
      their mounts. I gathered that one experience had dissuaded him from this
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That there little paint horse,&rdquo; observed Cousin Egbert genially, &ldquo;stepped
      out from under the Judge the prettiest you ever saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sure did,&rdquo; remarked the Honourable George, with a palpable effort to
      speak the American brogue. &ldquo;A most flighty beast he was&mdash;nerves all
      gone&mdash;I dare say a hopeless neurasthenic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then when I would have rebuked him for so shamefully disappointing the
      ladies of the Onwards and Upwards Society, he began to tell me of the
      public house he had just left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, you know that Spilmer chap, he&rsquo;s a genuine murderer&mdash;he let
      me hold the weapon with which he did it&mdash;and he has blind relatives
      dependent upon him, or something of that sort, otherwise I fancy they&rsquo;d
      have sent him to the gallows. And, by Gad! he&rsquo;s a witty scoundrel, what!
      Looking at his sign&mdash;leaving the settlement it reads, &lsquo;Last Chance,&rsquo; 
      but entering the settlement it reads, &lsquo;First Chance.&rsquo; Last chance and
      first chance for a peg, do you see what I mean? I tried it out; walked
      both ways under the sign and looked up; it worked perfectly. Enter the
      settlement, &lsquo;First Chance&rsquo;; leave the settlement, &lsquo;Last Chance.&rsquo; Do you
      see what I mean? Suggestive, what! Witty! You&rsquo;d never have expected that
      murderer-Johnny to be so subtle. Our own murderers aren&rsquo;t that way. I say,
      it&rsquo;s a tremendous wheeze. I wonder the press-chaps don&rsquo;t take it up. It&rsquo;s
      better than the blind factory, though the chap&rsquo;s mother or something is
      blind. What ho! But that&rsquo;s silly! To be sure one has nothing to do with
      the other. I say, have another, you chaps! I&rsquo;ve not felt so fit in ages.
      I&rsquo;m going to take up America!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plainly it was no occasion to use serious words to the man. He slapped his
      companions smartly on their backs and was slapped in turn by all of them.
      One or two of them called him an old horse! Not only was I doing no good
      for the North Side set, but I had felt obliged to consume two glasses of
      spirits that I did not wish. So I discreetly withdrew. As I went, the
      Honourable George was again telling them that he was &ldquo;going in&rdquo; for North
      America, and Cousin Egbert was calling &ldquo;Three rousing cheers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus luridly began, I may say, a scandal that was to be far-reaching in
      its dreadful effects. Far from feeling a proper shame on the following
      day, the Honourable George was as pleased as Punch with himself, declaring
      his intention of again consorting with the cattle and horse persons and
      very definitely declining an invitation to play at golf with
      Belknap-Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Golf!&rdquo; he spluttered. &ldquo;You do it, and then you&rsquo;ve directly to do it all
      over again. I mean to say, one gets nowhere. A silly game&mdash;what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wishing to be in no manner held responsible for his vicious pursuits, I
      that day removed my diggings from the Floud home to chambers in the
      Pettengill block above the Grill, where I did myself quite nicely with
      decent mantel ornaments, some vivacious prints of old-world cathedrals,
      and a few good books, having for body-servant one of the Hobbs lads who
      seemed rather teachable. I must admit, however, that I was frequently
      obliged to address him more sharply than one should ever address one&rsquo;s
      servant, my theory having always been that a serving person should be
      treated quite as if he were a gentleman temporarily performing menial
      duties, but there was that strain of lowness in all the Hobbses which
      often forbade this, a blending of servility with more or less skilfully
      dissembled impertinence, which I dare say is the distinguishing mark of
      our lower-class serving people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Removed now from the immediate and more intimate effects of the Honourable
      George&rsquo;s digressions, I was privileged for days at a time to devote my
      attention exclusively to my enterprise. It had thriven from the beginning,
      and after a month I had so perfected the minor details of management that
      everything was right as rain. In my catering I continued to steer a middle
      course between the British school of plain roast and boiled and a too
      often piffling French complexity, seeking to retain the desirable features
      of each. My luncheons for the tradesmen rather held to a cut from the
      joint with vegetables and a suitable sweet, while in my dinners I relaxed
      a bit into somewhat imaginative salads and entrées. For the tea-hour I
      constantly strove to provide some appetizing novelty, often, I confess,
      sacrificing nutrition to mere sightliness in view of my almost exclusive
      feminine patronage, yet never carrying this to an undignified extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of my sound judgment, dinner-giving in Red Gap began that
      winter to be done almost entirely in my place. There might be small
      informal affairs at home, but for dinners of any pretension the hostesses
      of the North Side set came to me, relying almost quite entirely upon my
      taste in the selection of the menu. Although at first I was required to
      employ unlimited tact in dissuading them from strange and laboured
      concoctions, whose photographs they fetched me from their women&rsquo;s
      magazines, I at length converted them from this unwholesome striving for
      novelty and laid the foundations for that sound scheme of gastronomy which
      to-day distinguishes this fastest-growing town in the state, if not in the
      West of America.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during these early months, I ought perhaps to say, that I rather
      distinguished myself in the matter of a relish which I compounded one day
      when there was a cold round of beef for luncheon. Little dreaming of the
      magnitude of the moment, I brought together English mustard and the
      American tomato catsup, in proportions which for reasons that will be made
      obvious I do not here disclose, together with three other and lesser
      condiments whose identity also must remain a secret. Serving this with my
      cold joint, I was rather amazed at the sensation it created. My patrons
      clamoured for it repeatedly and a barrister wished me to prepare a flask
      of it for use in his home. The following day it was again demanded and
      other requests were made for private supplies, while by the end of the
      week my relish had become rather famous. Followed a suggestion from Mrs.
      Judson as she overlooked my preparation of it one day from her own task of
      polishing the glassware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it on the market,&rdquo; said she, and at once I felt the inspiration of
      her idea. To her I entrusted the formula. I procured a quantity of
      suitable flasks, while in her own home she compounded the stuff and filled
      them. Having no mind to claim credit not my own, I may now say that this
      rather remarkable woman also evolved the idea of the label, including the
      name, which was pasted upon the bottles when our product was launched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruggles&rsquo; International Relish&rdquo; she had named it after a moment&rsquo;s thought.
      Below was a print of my face taken from an excellent photographic
      portrait, followed by a brief summary of the article&rsquo;s unsurpassed
      excellence, together with a list of the viands for which it was commended.
      As the International Relish is now a matter of history, the demand for it
      having spread as far east as Chicago and those places, I may add that it
      was this capable woman again who devised the large placard for hoardings
      in which a middle-aged but glowing bon-vivant in evening dress rebukes the
      blackamoor who has served his dinner for not having at once placed
      Ruggles&rsquo; International Relish upon the table. The genial annoyance of the
      diner and the apologetic concern of the black are excellently depicted by
      the artist, for the original drawing of which I paid a stiffish price to
      the leading artist fellow of Spokane. This now adorns the wall of my
      sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be supposed that I had been free during these months from
      annoyance and chagrin at the manner in which the Honourable George was
      conducting himself. In the beginning it was hoped both by Belknap-Jackson
      and myself that he might do no worse than merely consort with the rougher
      element of the town. I mean to say, we suspected that the apparent charm
      of the raffish cattle-persons might suffice to keep him from any notorious
      alliance with the dreaded Bohemian set. So long as he abstained from this
      he might still be received at our best homes, despite his regrettable
      fondness for low company. Even when he brought the murderer Spilmer to
      dine with him at my place, the thing was condoned as a freakish
      grotesquerie in one who, of unassailable social position, might well
      afford to stoop momentarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must say that the murderer&mdash;a heavy-jowled brute of husky voice,
      and quite lacking a forehead&mdash;conducted himself on this occasion with
      an entirely decent restraint of manner, quite in contrast to the
      Honourable George, who betrayed an expansively naïve pride in his guest,
      seeming to wish the world to know of the event. Between them they consumed
      a fair bottle of the relish. Indeed, the Honourable George was
      inordinately fond of this, as a result of which he would often come out
      quite spotty again. Cousin Egbert was another who became so addicted to it
      that his fondness might well have been called a vice. Both he and the
      Honourable George would drench quite every course with the sauce, and
      Cousin Egbert, with that explicit directness which distinguished his
      character, would frankly sop his bread-crusts in it, or even sip it with a
      coffee-spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have intimated, in spite of the Honourable George&rsquo;s affiliations with
      the slum-characters of what I may call Red Gap&rsquo;s East End, he had not yet
      publicly identified himself with the Klondike woman and her Bohemian set,
      in consequence of which&mdash;let him dine and wine a Spilmer as he would&mdash;there
      was yet hope that he would not alienate himself from the North Side set.
    </p>
    <p>
      At intervals during the early months of his sojourn among us he accepted
      dinner invitations at the Grill from our social leaders; in fact, after
      the launching of the International Relish, I know of none that he
      declined, but it was evident to me that he moved but half-heartedly in
      this higher circle. On one occasion, too, he appeared in the trousers of a
      lounge-suit of tweeds instead of his dress trousers, and with tan boots.
      The trousers, to be sure, were of a sombre hue, but the brown boots were
      quite too dreadfully unmistakable. After this I may say that I looked for
      anything, and my worst fears were soon confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began as the vaguest sort of gossip. The Honourable George, it was
      said, had been a guest at one of the Klondike woman&rsquo;s evening affairs. The
      rumour crystallized. He had been asked to meet the Bohemian set at a Dutch
      supper and had gone. He had lingered until a late hour, dancing the
      American folkdances (for which he had shown a surprising adaptability) and
      conducting himself generally as the next Earl of Brinstead should not have
      done. He had repeated his visit, repairing to the woman&rsquo;s house both
      afternoon and evening. He had become a constant visitor. He had spoken
      regrettably of the dulness of a meeting of the Onwards and Upwards Society
      which he had attended. He was in the woman&rsquo;s toils.
    </p>
    <p>
      With gossip of this sort there was naturally much indignation, and yet the
      leaders of the North Side set were so delicately placed that there was
      every reason for concealing it. They redoubled their attentions to the
      unfortunate man, seeking to leave him not an unoccupied evening or
      afternoon. Such was the gravity of the crisis. Belknap-Jackson alone
      remained finely judicial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The situation is of the gravest character,&rdquo; he confided to me, &ldquo;but we
      must be wary. The day isn&rsquo;t lost so long as he doesn&rsquo;t appear publicly in
      the creature&rsquo;s train. For the present we have only unverified rumour. As a
      man about town Vane-Basingwell may feel free to consort with vicious
      companions and still maintain his proper standing. Deplore it as all
      right-thinking people must, under present social conditions he is
      undoubtedly free to lead what is called a double life. We can only wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the state of the public mind, be it understood, up to the time of
      the notorious and scandalous defection of this obsessed creature, an
      occasion which I cannot recall without shuddering, and which inspired me
      to a course that was later to have the most inexplicable and far-reaching
      consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theatrical plays had been numerous with us during the season, with the
      natural result of many after-theatre suppers being given by those who
      attended, among them the North Side leaders, and frequently the Klondike
      woman with her following. On several of these occasions, moreover, the
      latter brought as supper guests certain representatives of the theatrical
      profession, both male and female, she apparently having a wide
      acquaintance with such persons. That this sort of thing increased her
      unpopularity with the North Side set will be understood when I add that
      now and then her guests would be of undoubted respectability in their
      private lives, as theatrical persons often are, and such as our smartest
      hostesses would have been only too glad to entertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      To counteract this effect Belknap-Jackson now broached to me a plan of
      undoubted merit, which was nothing less than to hold an afternoon
      reception at his home in honour of the world&rsquo;s greatest pianoforte artist,
      who was presently to give a recital in Red Gap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not met the chap myself,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;but I knew his secretary and
      travelling companion quite well in a happier day in Boston. The recital
      here will be Saturday evening, which means that they will remain here on
      Sunday until the evening train East. I shall suggest to my friend that his
      employer, to while away the tedium of the Sunday, might care to look in
      upon me in the afternoon and meet a few of our best people. Nothing
      boring, of course. I&rsquo;ve no doubt he will arrange it. I&rsquo;ve written him to
      Portland, where they now are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a card that will be,&rdquo; I instantly cried. &ldquo;Rather better class than
      entertaining strolling players.&rdquo; Indeed the merit of the proposal rather
      overwhelmed me. It would be dignified and yet spectacular. It would show
      the Klondike woman that we chose to have contact only with artists of
      acknowledged preëminence and that such were quite willing to accept our
      courtesies. I had hopes, too, that the Honourable George might be aroused
      to advantages which he seemed bent upon casting to the American winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later Belknap-Jackson joyously informed me that the great artist
      had consented to accept his hospitality. There would be light
      refreshments, with which I was charged. I suggested tea in the Russian
      manner, which he applauded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And everything dainty in the way of food,&rdquo; he warned me. &ldquo;Nothing common,
      nothing heavy. Some of those tiny lettuce sandwiches, a bit of caviare,
      macaroons&mdash;nothing gross&mdash;a decanter of dry sherry, perhaps, a
      few of the lightest wafers; things that cultivated persons may trifle with&mdash;things
      not repugnant to the artist soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I promised my profoundest consideration to these matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it occurs to me,&rdquo; he thoughtfully added, &ldquo;that this may be a time for
      Vane-Basingwell to silence the slurs upon himself that are becoming so
      common. I shall beg him to meet our guest at his hotel and escort him to
      my place. A note to my friend, &lsquo;the bearer, the Honourable George Augustus
      Vane-Basingwell, brother of his lordship the Earl of Brinstead, will take
      great pleasure in escorting to my home&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; You get the idea?
      Not bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again I applauded, resolving that for once the Honourable George would be
      suitably attired even if I had to bully him. And so was launched what
      promised to be Red Gap&rsquo;s most notable social event of the season. The
      Honourable George, being consulted, promised after a rather sulky
      hesitation to act as the great artist&rsquo;s escort, though he persisted in
      referring to him as &ldquo;that piano Johnny,&rdquo; and betrayed a suspicion that
      Belknap-Jackson was merely bent upon getting him to perform without price.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no,&rdquo; cried Belknap-Jackson, &ldquo;I should never think of anything so
      indelicate as asking him to play. My own piano will be tightly closed and
      I dare say removed to another room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the Honourable George professed to wonder why the chap was desired
      if he wasn&rsquo;t to perform. &ldquo;All hair and bad English&mdash;silly brutes when
      they don&rsquo;t play,&rdquo; he declared. In the end, however, as I have said, he
      consented to act as he was wished to. Cousin Egbert, who was present at
      this interview, took somewhat the same view as the Honourable George, even
      asserting that he should not attend the recital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t sing, he don&rsquo;t dance, he don&rsquo;t recite; just plays the piano.
      That ain&rsquo;t any kind of a show for folks to set up a whole evening for,&rdquo; he
      protested bitterly, and he went on to mention various theatrical pieces
      which he had considered worthy, among them I recall being one entitled
      &ldquo;The Two Johns,&rdquo; which he regretted not having witnessed for several
      years, and another called &ldquo;Ben Hur,&rdquo; which was better than all the piano
      players alive, he declared. But with the Honourable George enlisted, both
      Belknap-Jackson and I considered the opinions of Cousin Egbert to be quite
      wholly negligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturday&rsquo;s <i>Recorder</i>, in its advance notice of the recital,
      announced that the Belknap-Jacksons of Boston and Red Gap would entertain
      the artist on the following afternoon at their palatial home in the
      Pettengill addition, where a select few of the North Side set had been
      invited to meet him. Belknap-Jackson himself was as a man uplifted. He
      constantly revised and re-revised his invitation list; he sought me out
      each day to suggest subtle changes in the very artistic menu I had
      prepared for the affair. His last touch was to supplement the decanter of
      sherry with a bottle of vodka. About the caviare he worried quite
      fearfully until it proved upon arrival to be fresh and of prime quality.
      My man, the Hobbs boy, had under my instructions pressed and smarted the
      Honourable George&rsquo;s suit for afternoon wear. The carriage was engaged.
      Saturday night it was tremendously certain that no hitch could occur to
      mar the affair. We had left no detail to chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recital itself was quite all that could have been expected, but
      underneath the enthusiastic applause there ran even a more intense fervour
      among those fortunate ones who were to meet the artist on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belknap-Jackson knew himself to be a hero. He was elaborately cool. He
      smiled tolerantly at intervals and undoubtedly applauded with the least
      hint of languid proprietorship in his manner. He was heard to speak of the
      artist by his first name. The Klondike woman and many of her Bohemian set
      were prominently among those present and sustained glances of pitying
      triumph from those members of the North Side set so soon to be
      distinguished above her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morrow dawned auspiciously, very cloudy with smartish drives of wind
      and rain. Confined to the dingy squalor of his hotel, how gladly would the
      artist, it was felt, seek the refined cheer of one of our best homes where
      he would be enlivened by an hour or so of contact with our most cultivated
      people. Belknap-Jackson telephoned me with increasing frequency as the
      hour drew near, nervously seeming to dread that I would have overlooked
      some detail of his refined refreshments, or that I would not have them at
      his house on time. He telephoned often to the Honourable George to be
      assured that the carriage with its escort would be prompt. He telephoned
      repeatedly to the driver chap, to impress upon him the importance of his
      mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      His guests began to arrive even before I had decked his sideboard with
      what was, I have no hesitation in declaring, the most superbly dainty
      buffet collation that Red Gap had ever beheld. The atmosphere at once
      became tense with expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At three o&rsquo;clock the host announced from the telephone: &ldquo;Vane-Basingwell
      has started from the Floud house.&rdquo; The guests thrilled and hushed the
      careless chatter of new arrivals. Belknap-Jackson remained heroically at
      the telephone, having demanded to be put through to the hotel. He was
      flushed with excitement. A score of minutes later he announced with an
      effort to control his voice: &ldquo;They have left the hotel&mdash;they are on
      the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guests stiffened in their seats. Some of them nervously and for no
      apparent reason exchanged chairs with others. Some late arrivals bustled
      in and were immediately awed to the same electric silence of waiting.
      Belknap-Jackson placed the sherry decanter where the vodka bottle had been
      and the vodka bottle where the sherry decanter had been. &ldquo;The effect is
      better,&rdquo; he remarked, and went to stand where he could view the driveway.
      The moments passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At such crises, which I need not say have been plentiful in my life, I
      have always known that I possessed an immense reserve of coolness. Seldom
      have I ever been so much as slightly flustered. Now I was calmness itself,
      and the knowledge brought me no little satisfaction as I noted the rather
      painful distraction of our host. The moments passed&mdash;long, heavy,
      silent moments. Our host ascended trippingly to an upper floor whence he
      could see farther down the drive. The guests held themselves in smiling
      readiness. Our host descended and again took up his post at a lower
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moments passed&mdash;stilled, leaden moments. The silence had become
      intolerable. Our host jiggled on his feet. Some of the quicker-minded
      guests made a pretence of little conversational flurries: &ldquo;That second
      movement&mdash;oh, exquisitely rendered!... No one has ever read Chopin so
      divinely.... How his family must idolize him!... They say.... That
      exquisite concerto!... Hasn&rsquo;t he the most stunning hair.... Those staccato
      passages left me actually limp&mdash;I&rsquo;m starting Myrtle in Tuesday to
      take of Professor Gluckstein. She wants to take stenography, but I tell
      her.... Did you think the preludes were just the tiniest bit idealized....
      I always say if one has one&rsquo;s music, and one&rsquo;s books, of course&mdash;He
      must be very, <i>very</i> fond of music!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were the hushed, tentative fragments I caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moments passed. Belknap-Jackson went to the telephone. &ldquo;What? But
      they&rsquo;re not here! Very strange! They should have been here half an hour
      ago. Send some one&mdash;yes, at once.&rdquo; In the ensuing silence he repaired
      to the buffet and drank a glass of vodka. Quite distraught he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moments passed. Again several guests exchanged seats with other
      guests. It seemed to be a device for relieving the strain. Once more there
      were scattering efforts at normal talk. &ldquo;Myrtle is a strange girl&mdash;a
      creature of moods, I call her. She wanted to act in the moving pictures
      until papa bought the car. And she knows every one of the new tango steps,
      but I tell her a few lessons in cooking wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;Beryl Mae is just
      the same puzzling child; one thing one day, and another thing the next; a
      mere bundle of nerves, and so sensitive if you say the least little thing
      to her ... If we could only get Ling Wong back&mdash;this Jap boy is
      always threatening to leave if the men don&rsquo;t get up to breakfast on time,
      or if Gertie makes fudge in his kitchen of an afternoon ... Our boy sends
      all his wages to his uncle in China, but I simply can&rsquo;t get him to say,
      &lsquo;Dinner is served.&rsquo; He just slides in and says, &lsquo;All right, you come!&rsquo; 
      It&rsquo;s very annoying, but I always tell the family, &lsquo;Remember what a time we
      had with the Swede&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I mean to say, things were becoming rapidly impossible. The moments
      passed. Belknap-Jackson again telephoned: &ldquo;You did send a man after them?
      Send some one after him, then. Yes, at once!&rdquo; He poured himself another
      peg of the vodka. Silence fell again. The waiting was terrific. We had
      endured an hour of it, and but little more was possible to any sensitive
      human organism. All at once, as if the very last possible moment of
      silence had passed, the conversation broke loudly and generally: &ldquo;And did
      you notice that slimpsy thing she wore last night? Indecent, if you ask
      me, with not a petticoat under it, I&rsquo;ll be bound!... Always wears shoes
      twice too small for her ... What men can see in her ... How they can
      endure that perpetual smirk!...&rdquo; They were at last discussing the Klondike
      woman, and whatever had befallen our guest of honour I knew that those
      present would never regain their first awe of the occasion. It was now
      unrestrained gabble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second hour passed quickly enough, the latter half of it being
      enlivened by the buffet collation which elicited many compliments upon my
      ingenuity and good taste. Quite almost every guest partook of a glass of
      the vodka. They chattered of everything but music, I dare say it being
      thought graceful to ignore the afternoon&rsquo;s disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belknap-Jackson had sunk into a mood of sullen desperation. He drained the
      vodka bottle. Perhaps the liquor brought him something of the chill
      Russian fatalism. He was dignified but sodden, with a depression that
      seemed to blow from the bleak Siberian steppes. His wife was already
      receiving the adieus of their guests. She was smouldering ominously,
      uncertain where the blame lay, but certain there was blame. Criminal
      blame! I could read as much in her narrowed eyes as she tried for aplomb
      with her guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      My own leave I took unobtrusively. I knew our strangely missing guest was
      to depart by the six-two train, and I strolled toward the station. A block
      away I halted, waiting. It had been a time of waiting. The moments passed.
      I heard the whistle of the approaching train. At the same moment I was
      startled by the approach of a team that I took to be running away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw it was the carriage of the Pierce chap and that he was driving with
      the most abandoned recklessness. His passengers were the Honourable
      George, Cousin Egbert, and our missing guest. The great artist as they
      passed me seemed to feel a vast delight in his wild ride. He was cheering
      on the driver. He waved his arms and himself shouted to the maddened
      horses. The carriage drew up to the station with the train, and the three
      descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist hurriedly shook hands in the warmest manner with his
      companions, including the Pierce chap, who had driven them. He beckoned to
      his secretary, who was waiting with his bags. He mounted the steps of the
      coach, and as the train pulled out he waved frantically to the three. He
      kissed his hand to them, looking far out as the train gathered momentum.
      Again and again he kissed his hand to the hat-waving trio.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too much. The strain of the afternoon had told even upon my own
      iron nerves. I felt unequal at that moment to the simplest inquiry, and
      plainly the situation was not one to attack in haste. I mean to say, it
      was too pregnant with meaning. I withdrew rapidly from the scene, feeling
      the need for rest and silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I walked I meditated profoundly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER SIXTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      From the innocent lips of Cousin Egbert the following morning there fell a
      tale of such cold-blooded depravity that I found myself with difficulty
      giving it credit. At ten o&rsquo;clock, while I still mused pensively over the
      events of the previous day, he entered the Grill in search of breakfast,
      as had lately become his habit. I greeted him with perceptible restraint,
      not knowing what guilt might be his, but his manner to me was so
      unconsciously genial that I at once acquitted him of any complicity in
      whatever base doings had been forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his accustomed seat with a pleasant word to me. I waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feeling a mite off this morning,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;account of a lot of truck I
      eat yesterday. I guess I&rsquo;ll just take something kind of dainty. Tell
      Clarice to cook me up a nice little steak with plenty of fat on it, and
      some fried potatoes, and a cup of coffee and a few waffles to come. The
      Judge he wouldn&rsquo;t get up yet. He looked kind of mottled and anguished, but
      I guess he&rsquo;ll pull around all right. I had the chink take him up about a
      gallon of strong tea. Say, listen here, the Judge ain&rsquo;t so awful much of a
      stayer, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burning with curiosity I was to learn what he could tell me of the day
      before, yet I controlled myself to the calmest of leisurely questioning in
      order not to alarm him. It was too plain that he had no realization of
      what had occurred. It was always the way with him, I had noticed. Events
      the most momentous might culminate furiously about his head, but he never
      knew that anything had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Honourable George,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;was with you yesterday? Perhaps he ate
      something he shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did, he did; he done it repeatedly. He et pretty near as much of that
      sauerkraut and frankfurters as the piano guy himself did, and that&rsquo;s some
      tribute, believe me, Bill! Some tribute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The piano guy?&rdquo; I murmured quite casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And say, listen here, that guy is all right if anybody should ask you.
      You talk about your mixers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a bit puzzling, for of course I had never &ldquo;talked about my
      mixers.&rdquo; I shouldn&rsquo;t a bit know how to go on. I ventured another query.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was it this mixing and that sort of thing took place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, up at Mis&rsquo; Kenner&rsquo;s, where we was having a little party:
      frankfurters and sauerkraut and beer. My stars! but that steak looks good.
      I&rsquo;m feeling better already.&rdquo; His food was before him, and he attacked it
      with no end of spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me quite all about it,&rdquo; I amiably suggested, and after a moment&rsquo;s
      hurried devotion to the steak, he slowed up a bit to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, listen here, now. The Judge says to me when Eddie Pierce comes,
      &lsquo;Sour-dough,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;look in at Mis&rsquo; Kenner&rsquo;s this afternoon if you got
      nothing else on; I fancy it will repay you.&rsquo; Just like that. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I
      says, &lsquo;all right, Judge, I fancy I will. I fancy I ain&rsquo;t got anything else
      on,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;And I&rsquo;m always glad to go there,&rsquo; I says, because no matter
      what they&rsquo;re always saying about this here Bohemian stuff, Kate Kenner is
      one good scout, take it from me. So in a little while I slicked up some
      and went on around to her house. Then hitched outside I seen Eddie
      Pierce&rsquo;s hack, and I says, &lsquo;My lands! that&rsquo;s a funny thing,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;I
      thought the Judge was going to haul this here piano guy out to the Jackson
      place where he could while away the tejum, like Jackson said, and now it
      looks as if they was here. Or mebbe it&rsquo;s just Eddie himself that has
      fancied to look in, not having anything else on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so anyway I go up on the stoop and knock, and when I get in the
      parlour there the piano guy is and the Judge and Eddie Pierce, too, Eddie
      helping the Jap around with frankfurters and sauerkraut and beer and one
      thing and another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides them was about a dozen of Mis&rsquo; Kenner&rsquo;s own particular friends,
      all of &lsquo;em good scouts, let me tell you, and everybody laughing and
      gassing back and forth and cutting up and having a good time all around.
      Well, so as soon as they seen me, everybody says, &lsquo;Oh, here comes
      Sour-dough&mdash;good old Sour-dough!&rsquo; and all like that, and they
      introduced me to the piano guy, who gets up to shake hands with me and
      spills his beer off the chair arm on to the wife of Eddie Fosdick in the
      Farmers&rsquo; and Merchants&rsquo; National, and so I sat down and et with &lsquo;em and
      had a few steins of beer, and everybody had a good time all around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wonderful man appeared to believe that he had told me quite all of
      interest concerning this monstrous festivity. He surveyed the mutilated
      remnant of his steak and said: &ldquo;I guess Clarice might as well fry me a few
      eggs. I&rsquo;m feeling a lot better.&rdquo; I directed that this be done, musing upon
      the dreadful menu he had recited and recalling the exquisite finish of the
      collation I myself had prepared. Sausages, to be sure, have their place,
      and beer as well, but sauerkraut I have never been able to regard as an at
      all possible food for persons that really matter. Germans, to be sure!
    </p>
    <p>
      Discreetly I renewed my inquiry: &ldquo;I dare say the Honourable George was in
      good form?&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he et a lot. Him and the piano guy was bragging which could eat the
      most sausages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was unable to restrain a shudder at the thought of this revolting
      contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The piano guy beat him out, though. He&rsquo;d been at the Palace Hotel for
      three meals and I guess his appetite was right craving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And afterward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was like Jackson said: this lad wanted to while away the tejum
      of a Sunday afternoon, and so he whiled it, that&rsquo;s all. Purty soon Mis&rsquo; 
      Kenner set down to the piano and sung some coon songs that tickled him
      most to death, and then she got to playing ragtime&mdash;say, believe me,
      Bill, when she starts in on that rag stuff she can make a piano simply
      stutter itself to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration: MIS&rsquo; KENNER SET DOWN TO THE PIANO AND SUNG SOME COON SONGS
      THAT TICKLED HIM MOST TO DEATH}
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at that the piano guy says it&rsquo;s great stuff, and so he sets down
      himself to try it, and he catches on pretty good, I&rsquo;ll say that for him,
      so we got to dancing while he plays for us, only he don&rsquo;t remember the
      tunes good and has to fake a lot. Then he makes Mis&rsquo; Kenner play again
      while he dances with Mis&rsquo; Fosdick that he spilled the beer on, and after
      that we had some more beer and this guy et another plate of kraut and a
      few sausages, and Mis&rsquo; Kenner sings &lsquo;The Robert E. Lee&rsquo; and a couple more
      good ones, and the guy played some more ragtime himself, trying to get the
      tunes right, and then he played some fancy pieces that he&rsquo;d practised up
      on, and we danced some and had a few more beers, with everybody laughing
      and cutting up and having a nice home afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the piano guy enjoyed himself every minute, if anybody asks you,
      being lit up like a main chandelier. They made him feel like he was one of
      their own folks. You certainly got to hand it to him for being one little
      good mixer. Talk about whiling away the tejum! He done it, all right, all
      right. He whiled away so much tejum there he darned near missed his train.
      Eddie Pierce kept telling him what time it was, only he&rsquo;d keep asking Mis&rsquo; 
      Kenner to play just one more rag, and at last we had to just shoot him
      into his fur overcoat while he was kissing all the women on their hands,
      and we&rsquo;d have missed the train at that if Eddie hadn&rsquo;t poured the leather
      into them skates of his all the way down to the dee-po. He just did make
      it, and he told the Judge and Eddie and me that he ain&rsquo;t had such a good
      time since he left home. I kind of hated to see him go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He here attacked the eggs with what seemed to be a freshening of his
      remarkable appetite. And as yet, be it noted, I had detected no
      consciousness on his part that a foul betrayal of confidence had been
      committed. I approached the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Belknap-Jacksons were rather expecting him, you know. My impression
      was that the Honourable George had been sent to escort him to the
      Belknap-Jackson house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what I thought, too, but I guess the Judge forgot it, or
      mebbe he thinks the guy will mix in better with Mis&rsquo; Kenner&rsquo;s crowd.
      Anyway, there they was, and it probably didn&rsquo;t make any difference to the
      guy himself. He likely thought he could while away the tejum there as well
      as he could while it any place, all of them being such good scouts. And
      the Judge has certainly got a case on Mis&rsquo; Kenner, so mebby she asked him
      to drop in with any friend of his. She&rsquo;s got him bridle-wise and broke to
      all gaits.&rdquo; He visibly groped for an illumining phrase. &ldquo;He&mdash;he just
      looks at her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The simple words fell upon my ears with a sickening finality. &ldquo;He just
      looks at her.&rdquo; I had seen him &ldquo;just look&rdquo; at the typing-girl and at the
      Brixton milliner. All too fearfully I divined their preposterous
      significance. Beyond question a black infamy had been laid bare, but I
      made no effort to convey its magnitude to my guileless informant. As I
      left him he was mildly bemoaning his own lack of skill on the pianoforte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darned if I don&rsquo;t wish I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; took some lessons on the piano myself like
      that guy done. It certainly does help to while away the tejum when you got
      friends in for the afternoon. But then I was just a hill-billy. Likely I
      couldn&rsquo;t have learned the notes good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a half-hour later that I was called to the telephone to listen to
      the anguished accents of Belknap-Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard it?&rdquo; he called. I answered that I had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is a paranoiac. He should be at once confined in an asylum for
      the criminal insane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall row him fiercely about it, never fear. I&rsquo;ve not seen him yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the creature should be watched. He may do harm to himself or to some
      innocent person. They&mdash;they run wild, they kill, they burn&mdash;set
      fire to buildings&mdash;that sort of thing. I tell you, none of us is
      safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The situation,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;has even more shocking possibilities, but
      I&rsquo;ve an idea I shall be equal to it. If the worst seems to be imminent I
      shall adopt extreme measures.&rdquo; I closed the interview. It was too painful.
      I wished to summon all my powers of deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my amazement who should presently appear among my throng of luncheon
      patrons but the Honourable George. I will not say that he slunk in, but
      there was an unaccustomed diffidence in his bearing. He did not meet my
      eye, and it was not difficult to perceive that he had no wish to engage my
      notice. As he sought a vacant table I observed that he was spotted quite
      profusely, and his luncheon order was of the simplest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Straight I went to him. He winced a bit, I thought, as he saw me approach,
      but then he apparently resolved to brass it out, for he glanced full at me
      with a terrific assumption of bravado and at once began to give me beans
      about my service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your bally tea shop running down, what! Louts for waiters, cloddish
      louts! Disgraceful, my word! Slow beggars! Take a year to do you a rasher
      and a bit of toast, what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this absurd tirade I replied not a word, but stood silently regarding
      him. I dare say my gaze was of the most chilling character and steady. He
      endured it but a moment. His eyes fell, his bravado vanished, he fumbled
      with the cutlery. Quite abashed he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, your explanation!&rdquo; I said curtly, divining that the moment was one
      in which to adopt a tone with him. He wriggled a bit, crumpling a roll
      with panic fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; I commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face brightened, though with an intention most obviously false. He
      coughed&mdash;a cough of pure deception. Not only were his eyes averted
      from mine, but they were glassed to an uncanny degree. The fingers wrought
      piteously at the now plastic roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, the chap was taken bad; had to be seen to, what! Revived, I mean
      to say. All piano Johnnies that way&mdash;nervous wrecks, what! Spells!
      Spells, man&mdash;spells!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; I said crisply. The glassed eyes were those of one
      hypnotized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the carriage&mdash;to the hyphen chap&rsquo;s place, to be sure. Fainting
      spell&mdash;weak heart, what! No stimulants about. Passing house! Perhaps
      have stimulants&mdash;heart tablets, er&mdash;beer&mdash;things of that
      sort. Lead him in. Revive him. Quite well presently, but not well enough
      to go on. Couldn&rsquo;t let a piano Johnny die on our hands, what! Inquest,
      evidence, witnesses&mdash;all that silly rot. Save his life, what!
      Presence of mind! Kind hearts, what! Humanity! Do as much for any chap.
      Not let him die like a dog in the gutter, what! Get no credit, though&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       His curiously mechanical utterance trailed off to be lost in a mere husky
      murmur. The glassy stare was still at my wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have in the course of my eventful career had occasion to mark the
      varying degrees of plausibility with which men speak untruths, but never,
      I confidently aver, have I beheld one lie with so piteous a futility. The
      art&mdash;and I dare say with diplomat chaps and that sort it may properly
      be called an art&mdash;demands as its very essence that the speaker seem
      to be himself convinced of the truth of that which he utters. And the
      Honourable George in his youth mentioned for the Foreign Office!
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned away. The exhibition was quite too indecent. I left him to mince
      at his meagre fare. As I glanced his way at odd moments thereafter, he
      would be muttering feverishly to himself. I mean to say, he no longer <i>was</i>
      himself. He presently made his way to the street, looking neither to right
      nor left. He had, in truth, the dazed manner of one stupefied by some
      powerful narcotic. I wondered pityingly when I should again behold him&mdash;if
      it might be that his poor wits were bedevilled past mending.
    </p>
    <p>
      My period of uncertainty was all too brief. Some two hours later, full
      into the tide of our afternoon shopping throng, there issued a spectacle
      that removed any lingering doubt of the unfortunate man&rsquo;s plight. In the
      rather smart pony-trap of the Klondike woman, driven by the person
      herself, rode the Honourable George. Full in the startled gaze of many of
      our best people he advertised his defection from all that makes for a
      sanely governed stability in our social organism. He had gone flagrantly
      over to the Bohemian set.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could detect that his eyes were still glassy, but his head was erect. He
      seemed to flaunt his shame. And the guilty partner of his downfall drove
      with an affectation of easy carelessness, yet with a lift of the chin
      which, though barely perceptible, had all the effect of binding the
      prisoner to her chariot wheels; a prisoner, moreover, whom it was plain
      she meant to parade to the last ignominious degree. She drove leisurely,
      and in the little infrequent curt turns of her head to address her
      companion she contrived to instill so finished an effect of boredom that
      she must have goaded to frenzy any matron of the North Side set who
      chanced to observe her, as more than one of them did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thrice did she halt along our main thoroughfare for bits of shopping, a
      mere running into of shops or to the doors of them where she could issue
      verbal orders, the while she surveyed her waiting and drugged captive with
      a certain half-veiled but good-humoured insolence. At these moments&mdash;for
      I took pains to overlook the shocking scene&mdash;the Honourable George
      followed her with eyes no longer glassed; the eyes of helpless
      infatuation. &ldquo;He looks at her,&rdquo; Cousin Egbert had said. He had told it all
      and told it well. The equipage graced our street upon one paltry excuse or
      another for the better part of an hour, the woman being minded that none
      of us should longer question her supremacy over the next and eleventh Earl
      of Brinstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for another hour did the effects of the sensation die out among
      tradesmen and the street crowds. It was like waves that recede but
      gradually. They talked. They stopped to talk. They passed on talking. They
      hissed vivaciously; they rose to exclamations. I mean to say, there was no
      end of a gabbling row about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in my mind no longer any room for hesitation. The quite harshest
      of extreme measures must be at once adopted before all was too late. I
      made my way to the telegraph office. It was not a time for correspondence
      by post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward I had myself put through by telephone to Belknap-Jackson. With
      his sensitive nature he had stopped in all day. Although still averse to
      appearing publicly, he now consented to meet me at my chambers late that
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole town is seething with indignation,&rdquo; he called to me. &ldquo;It was
      disgraceful. I shall come at ten. We rely upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again I saw that he was concerned solely with his humiliation as a
      would-be host. Not yet had he divined that the deluded Honourable George
      might go to the unspeakable length of a matrimonial alliance with the
      woman who had enchained him. And as to his own disaster, he was less than
      accurate when he said that the whole town was seething with indignation.
      The members of the North Side set, to be sure, were seething furiously,
      but a flippant element of the baser sort was quite openly rejoicing. As at
      the time of that most slanderous minstrel performance, it was said that
      the Bohemian set had again, if I have caught the phrase, &ldquo;put a thing over
      upon&rdquo; the North Side set. Many persons of low taste seemed quite to enjoy
      the dreadful affair, and the members of the Bohemian set, naturally,
      throughout the day had been quite coarsely beside themselves with glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little they knew, I reflected, what power I could wield nor that I had
      already set in motion its deadly springs. Little did the woman dream,
      flaunting her triumph up and down our main business thoroughfare, that one
      who watched her there had but to raise his hand to wrest the victim from
      her toils. Little did she now dream that he would stop at no half
      measures. I mean to say, she would never think I could bowl her out as
      easy as buying cockles off a barrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the hour for our conference Belknap-Jackson arrived at my chambers
      muffled in an ulster and with a soft hat well over his face. I gathered
      that he had not wished to be observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel that this is a crisis,&rdquo; he began as he gloomily shook my hand.
      &ldquo;Where is our boasted twentieth-century culture if outrages like this are
      permitted? For the first time I understand how these Western communities
      have in the past resorted to mob violence. Public feeling is already
      running high against the creature and her unspeakable set.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I met this outburst with the serenity of one who holds the winning cards
      in his hand, and begged him to be seated. Thereupon I disclosed to him the
      weakly, susceptible nature of the Honourable George, reciting the
      incidents of the typing-girl and the Brixton milliner. I added that now,
      as before, I should not hesitate to preserve the family honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dreadful thing, indeed,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;if that adventuress should trap
      him into a marriage. Imagine her one day a Countess of Brinstead! But
      suppose the fellow prove stubborn; suppose his infatuation dulls all his
      finer instincts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I explained that the Honourable George, while he might upon the spur of
      the moment commit a folly, was not to be taken too seriously; that he was,
      I believed, quite incapable of a grand passion. I mean to say, he always
      forgot them after a few days. More like a child staring into shop-windows
      he was, rapidly forgetting one desired object in the presence of others. I
      added that I had adopted the extremest measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, perceiving that I had something in my sleeve, as the saying is,
      my caller besought me to confide in him. Without a word I handed him a
      copy of my cable message sent that afternoon to his lordship:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    <i>&ldquo;Your immediate presence required to prevent a monstrous
    folly.&rdquo;</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      He brightened as he read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You actually mean to say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His lordship,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;will at once understand the nature of what
      is threatened. He knows, moreover, that I would not alarm him without
      cause. He will come at once, and the Honourable George will be told what.
      His lordship has never failed. He tells him what perfectly, and that&rsquo;s
      quite all to it. The poor chap will be saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My caller was profoundly stirred. &ldquo;Coming here&mdash;to Red Gap&mdash;his
      lordship the Earl of Brinstead&mdash;actually coming here! My God! This is
      wonderful!&rdquo; He paused; he seemed to moisten his dry lips; he began once
      more, and now his voice trembled with emotion: &ldquo;He will need a place to
      stay; our hotel is impossible; had you thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He glanced
      at me appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that his lordship will be pleased to have you
      put him up; you would do him quite nicely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean it&mdash;seriously? That would be&mdash;oh, inexpressible. He
      would be our house guest! The Earl of Brinstead! I fancy that would
      silence a few of these serpent tongues that are wagging so venomously
      to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But before his coming,&rdquo; I insisted, &ldquo;there must be no word of his
      arrival. The Honourable George would know the meaning of it, and the
      woman, though I suspect now that she is only making a show of him, might
      go on to the bitter end. They must suspect nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had merely thought of a brief and dignified notice in our press,&rdquo; he
      began, quite wistfully, &ldquo;but if you think it might defeat our ends&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must wait until he has come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glorious!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It will be even more of a blow to them.&rdquo; He
      began to murmur as if reading from a journal, &ldquo;&lsquo;His lordship the Earl of
      Brinstead is visiting for a few days&rsquo;&mdash;it will surely be as much as a
      few days, perhaps a week or more&mdash;&lsquo;is visiting for a few days the C.
      Belknap-Jacksons of Boston and Red Gap.&rsquo;&rdquo; He seemed to regard the printed
      words. &ldquo;Better still, &lsquo;The C. Belknap-Jacksons of Boston and Red Gap are
      for a few days entertaining as their honoured house guest his lordship the
      Earl of Brinstead&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; Yes, that&rsquo;s admirable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He arose and impulsively clasped my hand. &ldquo;Ruggles, dear old chap, I
      shan&rsquo;t know at all how to repay you. The Bohemian set, such as are
      possible, will be bound to come over to us. There will be left of it but
      one unprincipled woman&mdash;and she wretched and an outcast. She has made
      me absurd. I shall grind her under my heel. The east room shall be
      prepared for his lordship; he shall breakfast there if he wishes. I fancy
      he&rsquo;ll find us rather more like himself than he suspects. He shall see that
      we have ideals that are not half bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrung my hand again. His eyes were misty with gratitude.

      CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three days later came the satisfying answer to my cable message:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    <i>&ldquo;Damn! Sailing Wednesday</i>.&mdash;BRINSTEAD.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Glad I was he had used the cable. In a letter there would doubtless have
      been still other words improper to a peer of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belknap-Jackson thereafter bore himself with a dignity quite tremendous
      even for him. Graciously aloof, he was as one carrying an inner light. &ldquo;We
      hold them in the hollow of our hand,&rdquo; said he, and both his wife and
      himself took pains on our own thoroughfare to cut the Honourable George
      dead, though I dare say the poor chap never at all noticed it. They spoke
      of him as &ldquo;a remittance man&rdquo;&mdash;the black sheep of a noble family. They
      mentioned sympathetically the trouble his vicious ways had been to his
      brother, the Earl. Indeed, so mysteriously important were they in
      allusions of this sort that I was obliged to caution them, lest they let
      out the truth. As it was, there ran through the town an undercurrent of
      puzzled suspicion. It was intimated that we had something in our sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether this tension was felt by the Honourable George, I had no means of
      knowing. I dare say not, as he is self-centred, being seldom aware of
      anything beyond his own immediate sensations. But I had reason to believe
      that the Klondike woman had divined some menace in our attitude of marked
      indifference. Her own manner, when it could be observed, grew increasingly
      defiant, if that were possible. The alliance of the Honourable George with
      the Bohemian set had become, of course, a public scandal after the day of
      his appearance in her trap and after his betrayal of the Belknap-Jacksons
      had been gossiped to rags. He no longer troubled himself to pretend any
      esteem whatever for the North Side set. Scarce a day passed but he
      appeared in public as the woman&rsquo;s escort. He flagrantly performed her
      commissions, and at their questionable Bohemian gatherings, with their
      beer and sausages and that sort of thing, he was the gayest of that gay,
      mad set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, of his old associates, Cousin Egbert quite almost alone seemed to
      find him any longer desirable, and him I had no heart to caution, knowing
      that I should only wound without enlightening him, he being entirely
      impervious to even these cruder aspects of class distinction. I dare say
      he would have considered the marriage of the Honourable George as no more
      than the marriage of one of his cattle-person companions. I mean to say,
      he is a dear old sort and I should never fail to defend him in the most
      disheartening of his vagaries, but he is undeniably insensitive to what
      one does and does not do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conviction ran, let me repeat, that we had another pot of broth on the
      fire. I gleaned as much from the Mixer, she being one of the few others
      besides Cousin Egbert in whose liking the Honourable George had not
      terrifically descended. She made it a point to address me on the subject
      over a dish of tea at the Grill one afternoon, choosing a table
      sufficiently remote from my other feminine guests, who doubtless, at their
      own tables, discussed the same complication. I was indeed glad that we
      were remote from other occupied tables, because in the course of her
      remarks she quite forcefully uttered an oath, which I thought it as well
      not to have known that I cared to tolerate in my lady patrons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to what Jackson feels about the way it was handed out to him that
      Sunday,&rdquo; she bluntly declared, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The oath
      quite dazed me for a moment, although I had been warned that she would use
      language on occasion. &ldquo;What I do care about,&rdquo; she went on briskly, &ldquo;is
      that I won&rsquo;t have this girl pestered by Jackson or by you or by any man
      that wears hair! Why, Jackson talks so silly about her sometimes you&rsquo;d
      think she was a bad woman&mdash;and he keeps hinting about something he&rsquo;s
      going to put over till I can hardly keep my hands off him. I just know
      some day he&rsquo;ll make me forget I&rsquo;m a lady. Now, take it from me, Bill, if
      you&rsquo;re setting in with him, don&rsquo;t start anything you can&rsquo;t finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Really she was quite fierce about it. I mean to say, the glitter in her
      eyes made me recall what Cousin Egbert had said of Mrs. Effie, her being
      quite entirely willing to take on a rattlesnake and give it the advantage
      of the first two assaults. Somewhat flustered I was, yet I hastened to
      assure her that, whatever steps I might feel obliged to take for the
      protection of the Honourable George, they would involve nothing at all
      unfair to the lady in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they better hadn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she resumed threateningly. &ldquo;That girl had a
      hard time all right, but listen here&mdash;she&rsquo;s as right as a church. She
      couldn&rsquo;t fool me a minute if she wasn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t you suppose I been around
      and around quite some? Just because she likes to have a good time and
      outdresses these dames here&mdash;is that any reason they should get out
      their hammers? Ain&rsquo;t she earned some right to a good time, tell me, after
      being married when she was a silly kid to Two-spot Kenner, the swine&mdash;and
      God bless the trigger finger of the man that bumped him off! As for the
      poor old Judge, don&rsquo;t worry. I like the old boy, but Kate Kenner won&rsquo;t do
      anything more than make a monkey of him just to spite Jackson and his band
      of lady knockers. Marry him? Say, get me right, Bill&mdash;I&rsquo;ll put it as
      delicate as I can&mdash;the Judge is too darned far from being a mental
      giant for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dare say she would have slanged me for another half-hour but for the
      constant strain of keeping her voice down. As it was, she boomed up now
      and again in a way that reduced to listening silence the ladies at several
      distant tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the various points she had raised, I was somewhat confused. About
      the Honourable George, for example: He was, to be sure, no mental giant.
      But one occupying his position is not required to be. Indeed, in the class
      to which he was born one well knows that a mental giant would be quite as
      distressingly bizarre as any other freak. I regretted not having retorted
      this to her, for it now occurred to me that she had gone it rather strong
      with her &ldquo;poor old Judge.&rdquo; I mean to say, it was almost quite a little bit
      raw for a native American to adopt this patronizing tone toward one of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet I found that my esteem for the Mixer had increased rather than
      diminished by reason of her plucky defence of the Klondike woman. I had no
      reason to suppose that the designing creature was worth a defence, but I
      could only admire the valour that made it. Also I found food for profound
      meditation in the Mixer&rsquo;s assertion that the woman&rsquo;s sole aim was to &ldquo;make
      a monkey&rdquo; of the Honourable George. If she were right, a mésalliance need
      not be feared, at which thought I felt a great relief. That she should
      achieve the lesser and perhaps equally easy feat with the poor chap was a
      calamity that would be, I fancied, endured by his lordship with a serene
      fortitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously enough, as I went over the Mixer&rsquo;s tirade point by point, I
      found in myself an inexplicable loss of animus toward the Klondike woman.
      I will not say I was moved to sympathy for her, but doubtless that strange
      ferment of equality stirred me toward her with something less than the
      indignation I had formerly felt. Perhaps she was an entirely worthy
      creature. In that case, I merely wished her to be taught that one must not
      look too far above one&rsquo;s station, even in America, in so serious an affair
      as matrimony. With all my heart I should wish her a worthy mate of her own
      class, and I was glad indeed to reflect upon the truth of my assertion to
      the Mixer, that no unfair advantage would be taken of her. His lordship
      would remove the Honourable George from her toils, a made monkey, perhaps,
      but no husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again that day did I listen to a defence of this woman, and from a source
      whence I could little have expected it. Meditating upon the matter, I
      found myself staring at Mrs. Judson as she polished some glassware in the
      pantry. As always, the worthy woman made a pleasing picture in her neat
      print gown. From staring at her rather absently I caught myself reflecting
      that she was one of the few women whose hair is always perfectly coiffed.
      I mean to say, no matter what the press of her occupation, it never goes
      here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the hair, my meditative eye, still rather absently, I believe,
      descended her quite good figure to her boots. Thereupon, my gaze ceased to
      be absent. They were not boots. They were bronzed slippers with high heels
      and metal buckles and of a character so distinctive that I instantly knew
      they had once before been impressed upon my vision. Swiftly my mind
      identified them: they had been worn by the Klondike woman on the occasion
      of a dinner at the Grill, in conjunction with a gown to match and a bluish
      scarf&mdash;all combining to achieve an immense effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      My assistant hummed at her task, unconscious of my scrutiny. I recall that
      I coughed slightly before disclosing to her that my attention had been
      attracted to her slippers. She took the reference lightly, affecting, as
      the sex will, to belittle any prized possession in the face of masculine
      praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen them before,&rdquo; I ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gives me all of hers. I haven&rsquo;t had to buy shoes since baby was born.
      She gives me&mdash;lots of things&mdash;stockings and things. She likes me
      to have them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you knew her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Years! I&rsquo;m there once a week to give the house a good going over. That
      Jap of hers is the limit. Dust till you can&rsquo;t rest. And when I clean he
      just grins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I mused upon this. The woman was already giving half her time to
      superintending two assistants in the preparation of the International
      Relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her work is too much in addition to your own,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? Work too hard? Not in a thousand years. I do all right for you, don&rsquo;t
      I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true; she was anything but a slacker. I more nearly approached my
      real objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman in your position,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t be too careful as to the
      associations she forms&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I had meant to go on, but found it
      quite absurdly impossible. My assistant set down the glass she had and
      quite venomously brandished her towel at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; she began, and almost could get no farther for mere
      sputtering. I mean to say, I had long recognized that she possessed
      character, but never had I suspected that she would have so inadequate a
      control of her temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; she sputtered again, &ldquo;And I thought you were too decent to
      join in that talk about a woman just because she&rsquo;s young and wears pretty
      clothes and likes to go out. I&rsquo;m astonished at you, I really am. I thought
      you were more of a man!&rdquo; She broke off, scowling at me most furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling all at once rather a fool, I sought to conciliate her. &ldquo;I have
      joined in no talk,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I merely suggested&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But she
      shut me off sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And let me tell you one thing: I can pick out my associates in this town
      without any outside help. The idea! That girl is just as nice a person as
      ever walked the earth, and nobody ever said she wasn&rsquo;t except those frumpy
      old cats that hate her good looks because the men all like her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old cats!&rdquo; I echoed, wishing to rebuke this violence of epithet, but she
      would have none of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nasty old spite-cats,&rdquo; she insisted with even more violence, and went on
      to an almost quite blasphemous absurdity. &ldquo;A prince in his palace wouldn&rsquo;t
      be any too good for her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut!&rdquo; I said, greatly shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut nothing!&rdquo; she retorted fiercely. &ldquo;A regular prince in his palace,
      that&rsquo;s what she deserves. There isn&rsquo;t a single man in this one-horse town
      that&rsquo;s good enough to pick up her glove. And she knows it, too. She&rsquo;s
      carrying on with your silly Englishman now, but it&rsquo;s just to pay those old
      cats back in their own coin. She&rsquo;ll carry on with him&mdash;yes! But
      marry? Good heavens and earth! Marriage is serious!&rdquo; With this novel
      conclusion she seized another glass and began to wipe it viciously. She
      glared at me, seeming to believe that she had closed the interview. But I
      couldn&rsquo;t stop. In some curious way she had stirred me rather out of myself&mdash;but
      not about the Klondike woman nor about the Honourable George. I began most
      illogically, I admit, to rage inwardly about another matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have other associates,&rdquo; I exclaimed quite violently, &ldquo;those
      cattle-persons&mdash;I know quite all about it. That Hank and Buck&mdash;they
      come here on the chance of seeing you; they bring you boxes of candy, they
      bring you little presents. Twice they&rsquo;ve escorted you home at night when
      you quite well knew I was only too glad to do it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I felt my
      temper most curiously running away with me, ranting about things I hadn&rsquo;t
      meant to at all. I looked for another outburst from her, but to my
      amazement she flashed me a smile with a most enigmatic look back of it.
      She tossed her head, but resumed her wiping of the glass with a certain
      demureness. She spoke almost meekly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re very old friends, and I&rsquo;m sure they always act right. I don&rsquo;t see
      anything wrong in it, even if Buck Edwards has shown me a good deal of
      attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this very meekness of hers seemed to arouse all the violence in my
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You have no right to receive presents from
      men. I tell you I won&rsquo;t have it! You&rsquo;ve no right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she suddenly said in the most curious, cool little voice, her
      eyes falling before mine. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I? I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was quite chilling, her tone and manner. I was cool in an instant.
      Things seemed to mean so much more than I had supposed they did. I mean to
      say, it was a fair crumpler. She paused in her wiping of the glass but did
      not regard me. I was horribly moved to go to her, but coolly remembered
      that that sort of thing would never do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust I have said enough,&rdquo; I remarked with entirely recovered dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean I won&rsquo;t have such things,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you,&rdquo; she said, and fell again to her work. I thereupon
      investigated an ice-box and found enough matter for complaint against the
      Hobbs boy to enable me to manage a dignified withdrawal to the rear. The
      remarkable creature was humming again as I left.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood in the back door of the Grill giving upon the alley, where I mused
      rather excitedly. Here I was presently interrupted by the dog, Mr. Barker.
      For weeks now I had been relieved of his odious attentions, by the very
      curious circumstance that he had transferred them to the Honourable
      George. Not all my kicks and cuffs and beatings had sufficed one whit to
      repulse him. He had kept after me, fawned upon me, in spite of them. And
      then on a day he had suddenly, with glad cries, become enamoured of the
      Honourable George, waiting for him at doors, following him, hanging upon
      his every look. And the Honourable George had rather fancied the beast and
      made much of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet this animal is reputed by poets and that sort of thing to be man&rsquo;s
      best friend, faithfully sharing his good fortune and his bad, staying by
      his side to the bitter end, even refusing to leave his body when he has
      perished&mdash;starving there with a dauntless fidelity. How chagrined the
      weavers of these tributes would have been to observe the fickle nature of
      the beast in question! For weeks he had hardly deigned me a glance. It had
      been a relief, to be sure, but what a sickening disclosure of the cur&rsquo;s
      trifling inconstancy. Even now, though he sniffed hungrily at the open
      door, he paid me not the least attention&mdash;me whom he had once
      idolized!
    </p>
    <p>
      I slipped back to the ice-box and procured some slices of beef that were
      far too good for him. He fell to them with only a perfunctory
      acknowledgment of my agency in procuring them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I thought you hated him!&rdquo; suddenly said the voice of his owner. She
      had tiptoed to my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; I said quite savagely, &ldquo;but the unspeakable beast can&rsquo;t be left to
      starve, can he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt her eyes upon me, but would not turn. Suddenly she put her hand
      upon my shoulder, patting it rather curiously, as she might have soothed
      her child. When I did turn she was back at her task. She was humming
      again, nor did she glance my way. Quite certainly she was no longer
      conscious that I stood about. She had quite forgotten me. I could tell as
      much from her manner. &ldquo;Such,&rdquo; I reflected, with an unaccustomed cynicism,
      &ldquo;is the light inconsequence of women and dogs.&rdquo; Yet I still experienced a
      curiously thrilling determination to protect her from her own good nature
      in the matter of her associates.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a later and cooler moment of the day I reflected upon her defence of
      the Klondike woman. A &ldquo;prince in his palace&rdquo; not too good for her! No
      doubt she had meant me to take these remarkable words quite seriously. It
      was amazing, I thought, with what seriousness the lower classes of the
      country took their dogma of equality, and with what naïve confidence they
      relied upon us to accept it. Equality in North America was indeed
      praiseworthy; I had already given it the full weight of my approval and
      meant to live by it. But at home, of course, that sort of thing would
      never do. The crude moral worth of the Klondike woman might be all that
      her two defenders had alleged, and indeed I felt again that strange little
      thrill of almost sympathy for her as one who had been unjustly aspersed.
      But I could only resolve that I would be no party to any unfair plan of
      opposing her. The Honourable George must be saved from her trifling as
      well as from her serious designs, if such she might have; but so far as I
      could influence the process it should cause as little chagrin as possible
      to the offender. This much the Mixer and my charwoman had achieved with
      me. Indeed, quite hopeful I was that when the creature had been set right
      as to what was due one of our oldest and proudest families she would find
      life entirely pleasant among those of her own station. She seemed to have
      a good heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the day of his lordship&rsquo;s arrival drew near, Belknap-Jackson became
      increasingly concerned about the precise manner of his reception and the
      details of his entertainment, despite my best assurances that no
      especially profound thought need be given to either, his lordship being
      quite that sort, fussy enough in his own way but hardly formal or
      pretentious.
    </p>
    <p>
      His prospective host, after many consultations with me, at length allowed
      himself to be dissuaded from meeting his lordship in correct afternoon
      garb of frock-coat and top-hat, consenting, at my urgent suggestion, to a
      mere lounge-suit of tweeds with a soft-rolled hat and a suitable rough day
      stick. Again in the matter of the menu for his lordship&rsquo;s initial dinner
      which we had determined might well be tendered him at my establishment.
      Both husband and wife were rather keen for an elaborate repast of many
      courses, feeling that anything less would be doing insufficient honour to
      their illustrious guest, but I at length convinced them that I quite knew
      what his lordship would prefer: a vegetable soup, an abundance of boiled
      mutton with potatoes, a thick pudding, a bit of scientifically correct
      cheese, and a jug of beer. Rather trying they were at my first mention of
      this&mdash;a dinner quite without finesse, to be sure, but eminently
      nutritive&mdash;and only their certainty that I knew his lordship&rsquo;s ways
      made them give in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair was to be confined to the family, his lordship the only guest,
      this being thought discreet for the night of his arrival in view of the
      peculiar nature of his mission. Belknap-Jackson had hoped against hope
      that the Mixer might not be present, and even so late as the day of his
      lordship&rsquo;s arrival he was cheered by word that she might be compelled to
      keep her bed with a neuralgia.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the afternoon train I accompanied him in his new motor-car, finding him
      not a little distressed because the chauffeur, a native of the town, had
      stoutly&mdash;and with some not nice words, I gathered&mdash;refused to
      wear the smart uniform which his employer had provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have shopped the fellow in an instant,&rdquo; he confided to me, &ldquo;had
      it been at any other time. He was most impertinent. But as usual, here I
      am at the mercy of circumstances. We couldn&rsquo;t well subject Brinstead to
      those loathsome public conveyances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We waited in the usual throng of the leisured lower-classes who are so
      naïvely pleased at the passage of a train. I found myself picturing their
      childish wonder had they guessed the identity of him we were there to
      meet. Even as the train appeared Belknap-Jackson made a last moan of
      complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Pettengill,&rdquo; he observed dejectedly, &ldquo;is about the house again and I
      fear will be quite well enough to be with us this evening.&rdquo; For a moment I
      almost quite disapproved of the fellow. I mean to say, he was vogue and
      all that, and no doubt had been wretchedly mistreated, but after all the
      Mixer was not one to be wished ill to.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later I was contrasting the quiet arrival of his lordship with
      the clamour and confusion that had marked the advent among us of the
      Honourable George. He carried but one bag and attracted no attention
      whatever from the station loungers. While I have never known him be
      entirely vogue in his appointments, his lordship carries off a lounge-suit
      and his gray-cloth hat with a certain manner which the Honourable George
      was never known to achieve even in the days when I groomed him. The
      grayish rather aggressive looking side-whiskers first caught my eye, and a
      moment later I had taken his hand. Belknap-Jackson at the same time took
      his bag, and with a trepidation so obvious that his lordship may perhaps
      have been excusable for a momentary misapprehension. I mean to say, he
      instantly and crisply directed Belknap-Jackson to go forward to the
      luggage van and recover his box.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bit awkward it was, to be sure, but I speedily took the situation in
      hand by formally presenting the two men, covering the palpable
      embarrassment of the host by explaining to his lordship the astounding
      ingenuity of the American luggage system. By the time I had deprived him
      of his check and convinced him that his box would be admirably recovered
      by a person delegated to that service, Belknap-Jackson, again in form, was
      apologizing to him for the squalid character of the station and for the
      hardships he must be prepared to endure in a crude Western village. Here
      again the host was annoyed by having to call repeatedly to his mechanician
      in order to detach him from a gossiping group of loungers. He came smoking
      a quite fearfully bad cigar and took his place at the wheel entirely
      without any suitable deference to his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship during the ride rather pointedly surveyed me, being
      impressed, I dare say, by something in my appearance and manner quite new
      to him. Doubtless I had been feeling equal for so long that the thing was
      to be noticed in my manner. He made no comment upon me, however. Indeed
      almost the only time he spoke during our passage was to voice his
      astonishment at not having been able to procure the London <i>Times</i> at
      the press-stalls along the way. His host made clucking noises of sympathy
      at this. He had, he said, already warned his lordship that America was
      still crude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crude? Of course, what, what!&rdquo; exclaimed his lordship. &ldquo;But naturally
      they&rsquo;d have the <i>Times</i>! I dare say the beggars were too lazy to look
      it out. Laziness, what, what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve a job teaching them to know their places,&rdquo; ventured
      Belknap-Jackson, moodily regarding the back of his chauffeur which somehow
      contrived to be eloquent with disrespect for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, what rot!&rdquo; rejoined his lordship. I saw that he had arrived in
      one of his peppery moods. I fancy he could not have recited a
      multiplication table without becoming fanatically assertive about it. That
      was his way. I doubt if he had ever condescended to have an opinion. What
      might have been opinions came out on him like a rash in form of the most
      violent convictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rot not to know their places, when they must know them!&rdquo; he
      snappishly added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, quite so!&rdquo; his host hastened to assure him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;dashed&mdash;fine big country you have,&rdquo; was his only other
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, indeed,&rdquo; murmured his host mildly. I had rather dreaded the oath
      which his lordship is prone to use lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the Belknap-Jackson house, his lordship was shown to the
      apartment prepared for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tea will be served in half an hour, your&mdash;er&mdash;Brinstead,&rdquo;
       announced his host cordially, although seemingly at a loss how to address
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, what, what! Tea, of course, of course! Why wouldn&rsquo;t it be?
      Meantime, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll have a word with Ruggles. At once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Belknap-Jackson softly and politely withdrew at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone with his lordship, I thought it best to acquaint him instantly with
      the change in my circumstances, touching lightly upon the matter of my now
      being an equal with rather most of the North Americans. He listened with
      exemplary patience to my brief recital and was good enough to felicitate
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assure you, glad to hear it&mdash;glad no end. Worthy fellow; always knew
      it. And equal, of course, of course! Take up their equality by all means
      if you take &lsquo;em up themselves. Curious lot of nose-talking beggars, and
      putting r&rsquo;s every place one shouldn&rsquo;t, but don&rsquo;t blame you. Do it myself
      if I could&mdash;England gone to pot. Quite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone to pot, sir?&rdquo; I gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t argue. Course it has. Women! Slasher fiends and firebrands!
      Pictures, churches, golf-greens, cabinet members&mdash;nothing safe.
      Pouring their beastly filth into pillar boxes. Women one knows. Hussies,
      though! Want the vote&mdash;rot! Awful rot! Don&rsquo;t blame you for America.
      Wish I might, too. Good thing, my word! No backbone in Downing Street. Let
      the fiends out again directly they&rsquo;re hungry. No system! No firmness! No
      dash! Starve &lsquo;em proper, I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was working himself into no end of a state. I sought to divert him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the Honourable George, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the silly ass up to now? Dancing girl got him&mdash;yes? How he
      does it, I can&rsquo;t think. No looks, no manner, no way with women. Can&rsquo;t
      stand him myself. How ever can they? Frightful bore, old George is. Well,
      well, man, I&rsquo;m waiting. Tell me, tell me, tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Briefly I disclosed to him that his brother had entangled himself with a
      young person who had indeed been a dancing girl or a bit like that in the
      province of Alaska. That at the time of my cable there was strong reason
      to believe she would stop at nothing&mdash;even marriage, but that I had
      since come to suspect that she might be bent only on making a fool of her
      victim, she being, although an honest enough character, rather inclined to
      levity and without proper respect for established families.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hinted briefly at the social warfare of which she had been a storm
      centre. I said again, remembering the warm words of the Mixer and of my
      charwoman, that to the best of my knowledge her character was without
      blemish. All at once I was feeling preposterously sorry for the creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship listened, though with a cross-fire of interruptions. &ldquo;Alaska
      dancing girl. Silly! Nothing but snow and mines in Alaska.&rdquo; Or, again,
      &ldquo;Make a fool of old George? What silly piffle! Already done it himself,
      what, what! Waste her time!&rdquo; And if she wasn&rsquo;t keen to marry him, had I
      called him across the ocean to intervene in a vulgar village squabble
      about social precedence? &ldquo;Social precedence silly rot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I insisted that his brother should be seen to. One couldn&rsquo;t tell what the
      woman might do. Her audacity was tremendous, even for an American. To this
      he listened more patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare say you&rsquo;re right. You don&rsquo;t go off your head easily. I&rsquo;ll rag him
      proper, now I&rsquo;m here. Always knew the ass would make a silly marriage if
      he could. Yes, yes, I&rsquo;ll break it up quick enough. I say I&rsquo;ll break it up
      proper. Dancers and that sort. Dangerous. But I know their tricks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A summons to tea below interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hungry, my word! Hardly dared eat in that dining-coach. Tinned stuff all
      about one. Appendicitis! American journal&mdash;some Colonel chap found it
      out. Hunting sort. Looked a fool beside his silly horse, but seemed to
      know. Took no chances. Said the tin-opener slays its thousands. Rot, no
      doubt. Perhaps not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I led him below, hardly daring at the moment to confess my own
      responsibility for his fears. Another time, I thought, we might chat of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belknap-Jackson with his wife and the Mixer awaited us. His lordship was
      presented, and I excused myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Pettengill, his lordship the Earl of Brinstead,&rdquo; had been the host&rsquo;s
      speech of presentation to the Mixer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do do, Earl; I&rsquo;m right glad to meet you,&rdquo; had been the Mixer&rsquo;s
      acknowledgment, together with a hearty grasp of the hand. I saw his
      lordship&rsquo;s face brighten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ho!&rdquo; he cried with the first cheerfulness he had exhibited, and the
      Mixer, still vigorously pumping his hand, had replied, &ldquo;Same here!&rdquo; with a
      vast smile of good nature. It occurred to me that they, at least, were
      quite going to &ldquo;get&rdquo; each other, as Americans say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come right in and set down in the parlour,&rdquo; she was saying at the last.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t eat between meals like you English folks are always doing, but
      I&rsquo;ll take a shot of hooch with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Belknap-Jacksons stood back not a little distressed. They seemed to
      publish that their guest was being torn from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A shot of hooch!&rdquo; observed his lordship &ldquo;I dare say your shooting over
      here is absolutely top-hole&mdash;keener sport than our popping at driven
      birds. What, what!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      At a latish seven, when the Grill had become nicely filled with a
      representative crowd, the Belknap-Jacksons arrived with his lordship. The
      latter had not dressed and I was able to detect that Belknap-Jackson,
      doubtless noting his guest&rsquo;s attire at the last moment, had hastily
      changed back to a lounge-suit of his own. Also I noted the absence of the
      Mixer and wondered how the host had contrived to eliminate her. On this
      point he found an opportunity to enlighten me before taking his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark my words, that old devil is up to something,&rdquo; he darkly said, and I
      saw that he was genuinely put about, for not often does he fall into
      strong language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After pushing herself forward with his lordship all through tea-time in
      the most brazen manner, she announces that she has a previous dinner
      engagement and can&rsquo;t be with us. I&rsquo;m as well pleased to have her absent,
      of course, but I&rsquo;d pay handsomely to know what her little game is. Imagine
      her not dining with the Earl of Brinstead when she had the chance! That
      shows something&rsquo;s wrong. I don&rsquo;t like it. I tell you she&rsquo;s capable of
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I mused upon this. The Mixer was undoubtedly capable of things. Especially
      things concerning her son-in-law. And yet I could imagine no opening for
      her at the present moment and said as much. And Mrs. Belknap-Jackson, I
      was glad to observe, did not share her husband&rsquo;s evident worry. She had
      entered the place plumingly, as it were, sweeping the length of the room
      before his lordship with quite all the manner her somewhat stubby figure
      could carry off. Seated, she became at once vivacious, chatting to his
      lordship brightly and continuously, raking the room the while with her
      lorgnon. Half a dozen ladies of the North Side set were with parties at
      other tables. I saw she was immensely stimulated by the circumstance that
      these friends were unaware of her guest&rsquo;s identity. I divined that before
      the evening was over she would contrive to disclose it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship responded but dully to her animated chat. He is never less
      urbane than when hungry, and I took pains to have his favourite soup
      served quite almost at once. This he fell upon. I may say that he has
      always a hearty manner of attacking his soup. Not infrequently he makes
      noises. He did so on this occasion. I mean to say, there was no finesse. I
      hovered near, anxious that the service should be without flaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head bent slightly over his plate, I saw a spoonful of soup ascending
      with precision toward his lips. But curiously it halted in mid-air, then
      fell back. His lordship&rsquo;s eyes had become fixed upon some one back of me.
      At once, too, I noted looks of consternation upon the faces of the
      Belknap-Jacksons, the hostess freezing in the very midst of some choice
      phrase she had smilingly begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned quickly. It was the Klondike person, radiant in the costume of
      black and the black hat. She moved down the hushed room with well-lifted
      chin, eyes straight ahead and narrowed to but a faint offended
      consciousness of the staring crowd. It was well done. It was superior. I
      am able to judge those things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching a table the second but one from the Belknap-Jacksons&rsquo;s, she
      relaxed finely from the austere note of her progress and turned to her
      companions with a pretty and quite perfect confusion as to which chair she
      might occupy. Quite awfully these companions were the Mixer, overwhelming
      in black velvet and diamonds, and Cousin Egbert, uncomfortable enough
      looking but as correctly enveloped in evening dress as he could ever
      manage by himself. His cravat had been tied many times and needed it once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were seated by the raccoon with quite all his impressiveness of
      manner. They faced the Belknap-Jackson party, yet seemed unconscious of
      its presence. Cousin Egbert, with a bored manner which I am certain he
      achieved only with tremendous effort, scanned my simple menu. The Mixer
      settled herself with a vast air of comfort and arranged various
      hand-belongings about her on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between them the Klondike woman sat with a restraint that would actually
      not have ill-become one of our own women. She did not look about; her
      hands were still, her head was up. At former times with her own set she
      had been wont to exhibit a rather defiant vivacity. Now she did not
      challenge. Finely, eloquently, there pervaded her a reserve that seemed
      almost to exhale a fragrance. But of course that is silly rot. I mean to
      say, she drew the attention without visible effort. She only waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Brinstead, as we all saw, had continued to stare. Thrice
      slowly arose the spoon of soup, for mere animal habit was strong upon him,
      yet at a certain elevation it each time fell slowly back. He was acting
      like a mechanical toy. Then the Mixer caught his eye and nodded crisply.
      He bobbed in response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ho! The dowager!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and that time the soup was
      successfully resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old mater!&rdquo; sighed his hostess. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s constantly taking up people.
      One does, you know, in these queer Western towns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jolly old thing, awfully good sort!&rdquo; said his lordship, but his eyes were
      not on the Mixer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terribly then I recalled the Honourable George&rsquo;s behaviour at that same
      table the night he had first viewed this Klondike person. His lordship was
      staring in much the same fashion. Yet I was relieved to observe that the
      woman this time was quite unconscious of the interest she had aroused. In
      the case of the Honourable George, who had frankly ogled her&mdash;for the
      poor chap has ever lacked the finer shades in these matters&mdash;she had
      not only been aware of it but had deliberately played upon it. It is not
      too much to say that she had shown herself to be a creature of
      blandishments. More than once she had permitted her eyes to rest upon him
      with that peculiarly womanish gaze which, although superficially of a
      blank innocence, is yet all-seeing and even shoots little fine arrows of
      questions from its ambuscade. But now she was ignoring his lordship as
      utterly as she did the Belknap-Jacksons.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure she may later have been in some way informed that his eyes were
      seeking her, but never once, I am sure, did she descend to even a veiled
      challenge of his glance or betray the faintest discreet consciousness of
      it. And this I was indeed glad to note in her. Clearly she must know where
      to draw the line, permitting herself a malicious laxity with a younger
      brother which she would not have the presumption to essay with the holder
      of the title. Pleased I was, I say, to detect in her this proper respect
      for his lordship&rsquo;s position. It showed her to be not all unworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner proceeded, his lordship being good enough to compliment me on
      the fare which I knew was done to his liking. Yet, even in the very
      presence of the boiled mutton, his eyes were too often upon his neighbour.
      When he behaved thus in the presence of a dish of mutton I had not to be
      told that he was strongly moved. I uneasily recalled now that he had once
      been a bit of a dog himself. I mean to say, there was talk in the
      countryside, though of course it had died out a score of years ago. I
      thought it as well, however, that he be told almost immediately that the
      person he honoured with his glance was no other than the one he had come
      to subtract his unfortunate brother from.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner progressed&mdash;somewhat jerkily because of his lordship&rsquo;s
      inattention&mdash;through the pudding and cheese to coffee. Never had I
      known his lordship behave so languidly in the presence of food he cared
      for. His hosts ate even less. They were worried. Mrs. Belknap-Jackson,
      however, could simply no longer contain within herself the secret of their
      guest&rsquo;s identity. With excuses to the deaf ears of his lordship she left
      to address a friend at a distant table. She addressed others at other
      tables, leaving a flutter of sensation in her wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belknap-Jackson, having lighted one of his non-throat cigarettes,
      endeavoured to engross his lordship with an account of their last election
      of officers to the country club. His lordship was not properly attentive
      to this. Indeed, with his hostess gone he no longer made any pretence of
      concealing his interest in the other table. I saw him catch the eye of the
      Mixer and astonishingly intercepted from her a swift but most egregious
      wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; said his lordship to the host. &ldquo;Must pay my respects to the
      dowager, what, what! Jolly old muggins, yes!&rdquo; And he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard the Mixer&rsquo;s amazing presentation speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Kenner, Mr. Floud, his lordship&mdash;say, listen here, is your
      right name Brinstead, or Basingwell, like your brother&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Klondike person acknowledged the thing with a faintly gracious nod. It
      carried an air, despite the slightness of it. Cousin Egbert was more
      cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleased to meet you, Lord!&rdquo; said he, and grasped the newcomer&rsquo;s hand.
      &ldquo;Come on, set in with us and have some coffee and a cigar. Here, Jeff,
      bring the lord a good cigar. We was just talking about you that minute.
      How do you like our town? Say, this here Kulanche Valley&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I
      lost the rest. His lordship had seated himself. At his own table
      Belknap-Jackson writhed acutely. He was lighting a second cigarette&mdash;the
      first not yet a quarter consumed!
    </p>
    <p>
      At once the four began to be thick as thieves, though it was apparent his
      lordship had eyes only for the woman. Coffee was brought. His lordship
      lighted his cigar. And now the word had so run from Mrs. Belknap-Jackson
      that all eyes were drawn to this table. She had created her sensation and
      it had become all at once more of one than she had thought. From Mrs.
      Judge Ballard&rsquo;s table I caught her glare at her unconscious mother. It was
      not the way one&rsquo;s daughter should regard one in public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently contriving to pass the table again, I noted that Cousin Egbert
      had changed his form of address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have some brandy with your coffee, Earl. Here, Jeff, bring Earl and all
      of us some lee-cures.&rdquo; I divined the monstrous truth that he supposed
      himself to be calling his lordship by his first name, and he in turn must
      have understood my shocked glance of rebuke, for a bit later, with glad
      relief in his tones, he was addressing his lordship as &ldquo;Cap!&rdquo; And myself
      he had given the rank of colonel!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Klondike person in the beginning finely maintained her reserve. Only
      at the last did she descend to vivacity or the use of her eyes. This later
      laxness made me wonder if, after all, she would feel bound to pay his
      lordship the respect he was wont to command from her class.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and poor George are rather alike,&rdquo; I overheard, &ldquo;except that he uses
      the single &lsquo;what&rsquo; and you use the double. Hasn&rsquo;t he any right to use the
      double &lsquo;what&rsquo; yet, and what does it mean, anyway? Tell us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, what!&rdquo; demanded his lordship, a bit puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s it! What do you say &lsquo;What, what&rsquo; for? It can&rsquo;t do you any
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, what! But I mean to say, you&rsquo;re having me on. My word you are&mdash;spoofing,
      I mean to say. What, what! To be sure. Chaffing lot, you are!&rdquo; He laughed.
      He was behaving almost with levity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But poor old George is so much younger than you&mdash;you must make
      allowances,&rdquo; I again caught her saying; and his lordship replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; not at all! Matter of a half-score years. Barely a
      half-score; nine and a few months. Younger? What rot! Chaffing again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Really it was a bit thick, the creature saying &ldquo;poor old George&rdquo; quite as
      if he were something in an institution, having to be wheeled about in a
      bath-chair with rugs and water-bottles!
    </p>
    <p>
      Glad I was when the trio gave signs of departure. It was woman&rsquo;s craft
      dictating it, I dare say. She had made her effect and knew when to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we shall have to talk over my dreadful designs on your poor old
      George,&rdquo; said the amazing woman, intently regarding his lordship at
      parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it to me,&rdquo; said he, with a scarcely veiled significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, see you again, Cap,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert warmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you
      around to meet some of the boys. We&rsquo;ll see you have a good time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ho!&rdquo; his lordship replied cordially. The Klondike person flashed him
      one enigmatic look, then turned to precede her companions. Again down the
      thronged room she swept, with that chin-lifted, drooping-eyed, faintly
      offended half consciousness of some staring rabble at hand that concerned
      her not at all. Her alert feminine foes, I am certain, read no slightest
      trace of amusement in her unwavering lowered glance. So easily she could
      have been crude here!
    </p>
    <p>
      Belknap-Jackson, enduring his ignominious solitude to the limit of his
      powers, had joined his wife at the lower end of the room. They had taken
      the unfortunate development with what grace they could. His lordship had
      dropped in upon them quite informally&mdash;charming man that he was. Of
      course he would quickly break up the disgraceful affair. Beginning at
      once. They would doubtless entertain for him in a quiet way&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the deserted table his lordship now relieved a certain sickening
      apprehension that had beset me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, what! Quite right to call me out here. Shan&rsquo;t forget it. Dangerous
      creature, that. Badly needed, I was. Can&rsquo;t think why you waited so long!
      Anything might have happened to old George. Break it up proper, though.
      Never do at all. Impossible person for him. Quite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw they had indeed taken no pains to hide the woman&rsquo;s identity from him
      nor their knowledge of his reason for coming out to the States, though
      with wretchedly low taste they had done this chaffingly. Yet it was only
      too plain that his lordship now realized what had been the profound
      gravity of the situation, and I was glad to see that he meant to end it
      without any nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly ass, old George, though,&rdquo; he added as the Belknap-Jacksons
      approached. &ldquo;How a creature like that could ever have fancied him! What,
      what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hosts were profuse in their apologies for having so thoughtlessly run
      away from his lordship&mdash;they carried it off rather well. They were
      keen for sitting at the table once more, as the other observant diners
      were lingering on, but his lordship would have none of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuffy place!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Best be getting on.&rdquo; And so, reluctantly, they
      led him down the gauntlet of widened eyes. Even so, the tenth Earl of
      Brinstead had dined publicly with them. More than repaid they were for the
      slight the Honourable George had put upon them in the affair of the
      pianoforte artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Belknap-Jackson had me on by telephone. His voice was not a
      little worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, is his lordship, the Earl, subject to spells of any sort? We were
      in the library where I was showing him some photographic views of dear old
      Boston, and right over a superb print of our public library he seemed to
      lose consciousness. Might it be a stroke? Or do you think it&rsquo;s just a
      healthy sleep? And shall I venture to shake him? How would he take that?
      Or should I merely cover him with a travelling rug? It would be so
      dreadful if anything happened when he&rsquo;s been with us such a little time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew his lordship. He has the gift of sleeping quite informally when his
      attention is not too closely engaged. I suggested that the host set his
      musical phonograph in motion on some one of the more audible selections.
      As I heard no more from him that night I dare say my plan worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our town, as may be imagined, buzzed with transcendent gossip on the
      morrow. The <i>Recorder</i> disclosed at last that the Belknap-Jacksons of
      Boston and Red Gap were quietly entertaining his lordship, the Earl of
      Brinstead, though since the evening before this had been news to hardly
      any one. Nor need it be said that a viciously fermenting element in the
      gossip concerned the apparently cordial meeting of his lordship with the
      Klondike person, an encounter that had been watched with jealous eyes by
      more than one matron of the North Side set. It was even intimated that if
      his lordship had come to put the creature in her place he had chosen a
      curious way to set about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also there were hard words uttered of the Belknap-Jacksons by Mrs. Effie,
      and severe blame put upon myself because his lordship had not come out to
      the Flouds&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Brinsteads have always stopped with us before,&rdquo; she went about
      saying, as if there had been a quite long succession of them. I mean to
      say, only the Honourable George had stopped on with them, unless, indeed,
      the woman actually counted me as one. Between herself and Mrs.
      Belknap-Jackson, I understood, there ensued early that morning by
      telephone a passage of virulent acidity, Mrs. Effie being heard by Cousin
      Egbert to say bluntly that she would get even.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly she did not share the annoyance of the Belknap-Jacksons at
      certain eccentricities now developed by his lordship which made him at
      times a trying house guest. That first morning he arose at five sharp, a
      custom of his which I deeply regretted not having warned his host about.
      Discovering quite no one about, he had ventured abroad in search of
      breakfast, finding it at length in the eating establishment known as
      &ldquo;Bert&rsquo;s Place,&rdquo; in company with engine-drivers, plate-layers, milk
      persons, and others of a common sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter he had tramped furiously about the town and its environs for
      some hours, at last encountering Cousin Egbert who escorted him to the
      Floud home for his first interview with the Honourable George. The latter
      received his lordship in bed, so Cousin Egbert later informed me. He had
      left the two together, whereupon for an hour there were heard quite all
      over the house words of the most explosive character. Cousin Egbert, much
      alarmed at the passionate beginning of the interview, suspected they might
      do each other a mischief, and for some moments hovered about with the aim,
      if need be, of preserving human life. But as the uproar continued evenly,
      he at length concluded they would do no more than talk, the outcome
      proving the accuracy of his surmise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Effie, meantime, saw her opportunity and seized it with a cool
      readiness which I have often remarked in her. Belknap-Jackson, distressed
      beyond measure at the strange absence of his guest, had communicated with
      me by telephone several times without result. Not until near noon was I
      able to give him any light. Mrs. Effie had then called me to know what his
      lordship preferred for luncheon. Replying that cold beef, pickles, and
      beer were his usual mid-day fancy, I hastened to allay the fears of the
      Belknap-Jacksons, only to find that Mrs. Effie had been before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says,&rdquo; came the annoyed voice of the host, &ldquo;that the dear Earl
      dropped in for a chat with his brother and has most delightfully begged
      her to give him luncheon. She says he will doubtless wish to drive with
      them this afternoon, but I had already planned to drive him myself&mdash;to
      the country club and about. The woman is high-handed, I must say. For
      God&rsquo;s sake, can&rsquo;t you do something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to tell him straight that the thing was beyond me, though I
      promised to recover his guest promptly, should any opportunity occur. The
      latter did not, however, drive with the Flouds that afternoon. He was
      observed walking abroad with Cousin Egbert, and it was later reported by
      persons of unimpeachable veracity that they had been seen to enter the
      Klondike person&rsquo;s establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evening drew on without further news. But then certain elated members of
      the Bohemian set made it loosely known that they were that evening to dine
      informally at their leader&rsquo;s house to meet his lordship. It seemed a bit
      extraordinary to me, yet I could not but rejoice that he should thus adopt
      the peaceful methods of diplomacy for the extrication of his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belknap-Jackson now telephoning to know if I had heard this report&mdash;&ldquo;canard&rdquo;
       he styled it&mdash;I confirmed it and remarked that his lordship was
      undoubtedly by way of bringing strong pressure to bear on the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I had expected him to meet a few people here this evening,&rdquo; cried the
      host pathetically. I was then obliged to tell him that the Brinsteads for
      centuries had been bluntly averse to meeting a few people. It seemed to
      run in the blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian dinner, although quite informal, was said to have been highly
      enjoyed by all, including the Honourable George, who was among those
      present, as well as Cousin Egbert. The latter gossiped briefly of the
      affair the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, the Cap had a good time all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course he ain&rsquo;t
      the mixer the Judge is, but he livens up quite some, now and then. Talks
      like a bunch of firecrackers going off all to once, don&rsquo;t he? Funny guy. I
      walked with him to the Jacksons&rsquo; about twelve or one. He&rsquo;s going back to
      Mis&rsquo; Kenner&rsquo;s house today. He says it&rsquo;ll take a lot of talking back and
      forth to get this thing settled right, and it&rsquo;s got to be right, he says.
      He seen that right off.&rdquo; He paused as if to meditate profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you was to ask me, though, I&rsquo;d say she had him&mdash;just like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held an open hand toward me, then tightly clenched it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suspecting he might spread absurd gossip of this sort, I explained
      carefully to him that his lordship had indeed at once perceived her to be
      a dangerous woman; and that he was now taking his own cunning way to break
      off the distressing affair between her and his brother. He listened
      patiently, but seemed wedded to some monstrous view of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them dames of that there North Side set better watch out,&rdquo; he remarked
      ominously. &ldquo;First thing they know, what that Kate Kenner&rsquo;ll hand them&mdash;they
      can make a lemonade out of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could make but little of this, save its general import, which was of
      course quite shockingly preposterous. I found myself wishing, to be sure,
      that his lordship had been able to accomplish his mission to North America
      without appearing to meet the person as a social equal, as I feared indeed
      that a wrong impression of his attitude would be gained by the
      undiscerning public. It might have been better, I was almost quite
      certain, had he adopted a stern and even brutal method at the outset,
      instead of the circuitous and diplomatic. Belknap-Jackson shared this view
      with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hate dreadfully to have his lordship&rsquo;s reputation suffer for
      this,&rdquo; he confided to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first week dragged to its close in this regrettable fashion. Oftener
      than not his hosts caught no glimpse of his lordship throughout the day.
      The smart trap and the tandem team were constantly ready, but he had not
      yet been driven abroad by his host. Each day he alleged the necessity of
      conferring with the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dangerous creature, my word! But dangerous!&rdquo; he would announce. &ldquo;Takes no
      end of managing. Do it, though; do it proper. Take a high hand with her.
      Can&rsquo;t have silly old George in a mess. Own brother, what, what! Time
      needed, though. Not with you at dinner, if you don&rsquo;t mind. Creature has a
      way of picking up things not half nasty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But each day Belknap-Jackson met him with pressing offers of such
      entertainment as the town afforded. Three times he had been
      obliged to postpone the informal evening affair for a few smart people.
      Yet, though patient, he was determined. Reluctantly at last he abandoned
      the design of driving his guest about in the trap, but he insistently put
      forward the motor-car. He would drive it himself. They would spend
      pleasant hours going about the country. His lordship continued elusive. To
      myself he confided that his host was a nagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully nagging sort, yes. Doesn&rsquo;t know the strain I&rsquo;m under getting this
      silly affair straight. Country interesting no doubt, what, what! But, my
      word! saw nothing but country coming out. Country quite all about, miles
      and miles both sides of the metals. Seen enough country. Seen motor-cars,
      too, my word. Enough of both, what, what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet it seemed that on the Saturday after his arrival he could no longer
      decently put off his insistent host. He consented to accompany him in the
      motor-car. Rotten judging it was on the part of Belknap-Jackson. He should
      have listened to me. They departed after luncheon, the host at the wheel.
      I had his account of such following events as I did not myself observe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our country club,&rdquo; he observed early in the drive. &ldquo;No one there, of
      course. You&rsquo;d never believe the trouble I&rsquo;ve had&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jolly good club,&rdquo; replied his lordship. &ldquo;Drive back that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back that way,&rdquo; it appeared, would take them by the detached villa of the
      Klondike person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop here,&rdquo; directed his lordship. &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t detain you a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was at two-thirty of a fair afternoon. I am able to give but the bare
      facts, yet I must assume that the emotions of Belknap-Jackson as he waited
      there during the ensuing two hours were of a quite distressing nature. As
      much was intimated by several observant townspeople who passed him. He was
      said to be distrait; to be smoking his cigarettes furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four-thirty his lordship reappeared. With apparent solicitude he
      escorted the Klondike person, fetchingly gowned in a street costume of the
      latest mode. They chatted gayly to the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope I&rsquo;ve not kept you waiting, old chap,&rdquo; said his lordship genially.
      &ldquo;Time slips by one so. You two met, of course, course!&rdquo; He bestowed his
      companion in the tonneau and ensconced himself beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to your goods shops, draper&rsquo;s, chemist&rsquo;s&mdash;where
      was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Central Market,&rdquo; responded the lady in bell-like tones, &ldquo;then to
      the Red Front store, and to that dear little Japanese shop, if he doesn&rsquo;t
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind! Mind! Course not, course not! Are you warm? Let me fasten the
      robe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I confess to have felt a horrid fascination for this moment as I was able
      to reconstruct it from Belknap-Jackson&rsquo;s impassioned words. It was by way
      of being one of those scenes we properly loathe yet morbidly cannot resist
      overlooking if opportunity offers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the flood tide of our Saturday shopping throng swept the car and its
      remarkably assembled occupants. The street fair gasped. The woman&rsquo;s former
      parade of the Honourable George had been as nothing to this exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Jackson&rsquo;s face was a study,&rdquo; declared the Mixer to me later.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dare say. It was still a study when my own turn came to observe it. The
      car halted before the shops that had been designated. The Klondike person
      dispatched her commissions in a superbly leisured manner, attentively
      accompanied by the Earl of Brinstead bearing packages for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belknap-Jackson, at the wheel, stared straight ahead. I am told he bore
      himself with dignity even when some of our more ingenuous citizens paused
      to converse with him concerning his new motor-car. He is even said to have
      managed a smile when his passengers returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; exclaimed his lordship now. &ldquo;Deuced good plan&mdash;go to
      that Ruggles place for a jolly fat tea. No end of a spree, what, what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is said that on three occasions in turning his car and traversing the
      short block to the Grill the owner escaped disastrous collision with other
      vehicles only by the narrowest possible margin. He may have courted
      something of the sort. I dare say he was desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Join us, of course!&rdquo; said his lordship, as he assisted his companion to
      alight. Again I am told the host managed to illumine his refusal with a
      smile. He would take no tea&mdash;the doctor&rsquo;s orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprising pair entered at the height of my tea-hour and were served
      to an accompaniment of stares from the ladies present. To this they
      appeared oblivious, being intent upon their conference. His lordship was
      amiable to a degree. It now occurred to me that he had found the woman
      even more dangerous than he had at first supposed. He was being forced to
      play a deep game with her and was meeting guile with guile. He had, I
      suspected, found his poor brother far deeper in than any of us had
      thought. Doubtless he had written compromising letters that must be
      secured&mdash;letters she would hold at a price.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet I had never before had excuse to believe his lordship possessed
      the diplomatic temperament. I reflected that I must always have misread
      him. He was deep, after all. Not until the two left did I learn that
      Belknap-Jackson awaited them with his car. He loitered about in adjacent
      doorways, quite like a hired fellow. He was passionately smoking more
      cigarettes than were good for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I escorted my guests to the car. Belknap-Jackson took his seat with but
      one glance at me, yet it was eloquent of all the ignominy that had been
      heaped upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home, I think,&rdquo; said the lady when they were well seated. She said it
      charmingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; repeated his lordship. &ldquo;Are you quite protected by the robe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An incautious pedestrian at the next crossing narrowly escaped being run
      down. He shook a fist at the vanishing car and uttered a stream of oaths
      so vile that he would instantly have been taken up in any well-policed
      city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Belknap-Jackson called me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got out with that fiend! He&rsquo;s staying on there. But, my God! can
      nothing be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His lordship is playing a most desperate game,&rdquo; I hastened to assure him.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s meeting difficulties. She must have her dupe&rsquo;s letters in her
      possession. Blackmail, I dare say. Best leave his lordship free. He&rsquo;s a
      deep character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He presumed far this afternoon&mdash;only the man&rsquo;s position saved him
      with me!&rdquo; His voice seemed choked with anger. Then, remotely, faint as
      distant cannonading, a rumble reached me. It was hoarse laughter of the
      Mixer, perhaps in another room. The electric telephone has been perfected
      in the States to a marvellous delicacy of response.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now found myself observing Mrs. Effie, who had been among the absorbed
      onlookers while the pair were at their tea, she having occupied a table
      with Mrs. Judge Ballard and Mrs. Dr. Martingale. Deeply immersed in
      thought she had been, scarce replying to her companions. Her eyes had
      narrowed in a way I well knew when she reviewed the social field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still absorbed she was when Cousin Egbert entered, accompanied by the
      Honourable George. The latter had seen but little of his brother since
      their first stormy interview, but he had also seen little of the Klondike
      woman. His spirits, however, had seemed quite undashed. He rarely missed
      his tea. Now as they seated themselves they were joined quickly by Mrs.
      Effie, who engaged her relative in earnest converse. It was easy to see
      that she begged a favour. She kept a hand on his arm. She urged.
      Presently, seeming to have achieved her purpose, she left them, and I
      paused to greet the pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that there Mrs. Effie is awful silly,&rdquo; remarked Cousin Egbert
      enigmatically. &ldquo;No, sir; she can&rsquo;t ever tell how the cat is going to
      jump.&rdquo; Nor would he say more, though he most elatedly held a secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this circumstance I connected the announcement in Monday&rsquo;s <i>Recorder</i>
      that Mrs. Senator Floud would on that evening entertain at dinner the
      members of Red Gap&rsquo;s Bohemian set, including Mrs. Kate Kenner, the guest
      of honour being his lordship the Earl of Brinstead, &ldquo;at present visiting
      in this city. Covers,&rdquo; it added, &ldquo;would be laid for fourteen.&rdquo; I saw that
      Cousin Egbert would have been made the ambassador to conduct what must
      have been a business of some delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the members of the North Side set the report occasioned the wildest
      alarm. And yet so staunch were known to be the principles of Mrs. Effie
      that but few accused her of downright treachery. It seemed to be felt that
      she was but lending herself to the furtherance of some deep design of his
      lordship&rsquo;s. Blackmail, the recovery of compromising letters, the avoidance
      of legal proceedings&mdash;these were hinted at. For myself I suspected
      that she had merely misconstrued the seeming cordiality of his lordship
      toward the woman and, at the expense of the Belknap-Jacksons, had sought
      the honour of entertaining him. If, to do that, she must entertain the
      woman, well and good. She was not one to funk her fences with the game in
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consulting me as to the menu for her dinner, she allowed herself to be
      persuaded to the vegetable soup, boiled mutton, thick pudding, and cheese
      which I recommended, though she pleaded at length for a chance to use the
      new fish set and for a complicated salad portrayed in her latest woman&rsquo;s
      magazine. Covered with grated nuts it was in the illustration. I was able,
      however, to convince her that his lordship would regard grated nuts as
      silly.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Belknap-Jackson I learned by telephone (during these days, being
      sensitive, he stopped in almost quite continuously) that Mrs. Effie had
      profusely explained to his wife about the dinner. &ldquo;Of course, my dear, I
      couldn&rsquo;t have the presumption to ask you and your husband to sit at table
      with the creature, even if he did think it all right to drive her about
      town on a shopping trip. But I thought we ought to do something to make
      the dear Earl&rsquo;s visit one to be remembered&mdash;he&rsquo;s <i>so</i>
      appreciative! I&rsquo;m sure you understand just how things are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In reciting this speech to me Belknap-Jackson essayed to simulate the tone
      and excessive manner of a woman gushing falsely. The fellow was quite
      bitter about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes think I&rsquo;ll give up,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;God only knows what
      things are coming to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It began to seem even to me that they were coming a bit thick. But I knew
      that his lordship was a determined man. He was of the bulldog breed that
      has made old England what it is. I mean to say, I knew he would put the
      woman in her place.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER NINETEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Echoes of the Monday night dinner reached me the following day. The affair
      had passed off pleasantly enough, the members of the Bohemian set
      conducting themselves quite as persons who mattered, with the exception of
      the Klondike woman herself, who, I gathered, had descended to a mood of
      most indecorous liveliness considering who the guest of honour was. She
      had not only played and sung those noisy native folksongs of hers, but she
      had, it seemed, conducted herself with a certain facetious familiarity
      toward his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every now and then,&rdquo; said Cousin Egbert, my principal informant, &ldquo;she&rsquo;d
      whirl in and josh the Cap all over the place about them funny whiskers he
      wears. She told him out and out he&rsquo;d just got to lose them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shocking rudeness!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sure, sure!&rdquo; he agreed, yet without indignation. &ldquo;And the Cap just
      hated her for it&mdash;you could tell that by the way he looked at her.
      Oh, he hates her something terrible. He just can&rsquo;t bear the sight of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally enough,&rdquo; I observed, though there had been an undercurrent to
      his speech that I thought almost quite a little odd. His accents were
      queerly placed. Had I not known him too well I should have thought him
      trying to be deep. I recalled his other phrases, that Mrs. Effie was
      seeing which way a cat would leap, and that the Klondike person would hand
      the ladies of the North Side set a lemon squash. I put them all down as
      childish prattle and said as much to the Mixer later in the day as she had
      a dish of tea at the Grill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sour-dough&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;That Earl just hates the sight
      of her&mdash;can&rsquo;t bear to look at her a minute.&rdquo; But she, too, intoned
      the thing queerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s putting pressure to bear on her,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pressure!&rdquo; said the Mixer; and then, &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; very dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this news, however, it was plain as a pillar-box that things were
      going badly with his lordship&rsquo;s effort to release the Honourable George
      from his entanglement. The woman, doubtless with his compromising letters,
      would be holding out for a stiffish price; she would think them worth no
      end. And plainly again, his lordship had thrown off his mask; was unable
      longer to conceal his aversion for her. This, to be sure, was more in
      accordance with his character as I had long observed it. If he hated her
      it was like him to show it when he looked at her. I mean he was quite like
      that with almost any one. I hoped, however, that diplomacy might still
      save us all sorts of a nasty row.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my relief when the pair appeared for tea that afternoon&mdash;a sight
      no longer causing the least sensation&mdash;I saw that his lordship must
      have returned to his first or diplomatic manner. Doubtless he still hated
      her, but one would little have suspected it from his manner of looking at
      her. I mean to say, he looked at her another way. The opposite way, in
      fact. He was being subtle in the extreme. I fancied it must have been her
      wretched levity regarding his beard that had goaded him into the
      exhibitions of hatred noted by Cousin Egbert and the Mixer. Unquestionably
      his lordship may be goaded in no time if one deliberately sets about it.
      At the time, doubtless, he had sliced a drive or two, as one might say,
      but now he was back in form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I confess I was not a little sorry for the creature, seeing her
      there so smartly taken in by his effusive manner. He was having her on in
      the most obvious way and she, poor dupe, taking it all quite seriously.
      Prime it was, though, considering the creature&rsquo;s designs; and I again
      marvelled that in all the years of my association with his lordship I had
      never suspected what a topping sort he could be at this game. His mask was
      now perfect. It recalled, indeed, Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s simple but telling
      phrase about the Honourable George&mdash;&ldquo;He looks at her!&rdquo; It could now
      have been said of his lordship with the utmost significance to any but
      those in the know.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so began, quite as had the first, the second week of his lordship&rsquo;s
      stay among us. Knowing he had booked a return from Cooks, I fancied that
      results of some sort must soon ensue. The pressure he was putting on the
      woman must begin to tell. And this was the extreme of the encouragement I
      was able to offer the Belknap-Jacksons. Both he and his wife were of
      course in a bit of a state. Nor could I blame them. With an Earl for house
      guest they must be content with but a glimpse of him at odd moments.
      Rather a barren honour they were finding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship&rsquo;s conferences with the woman were unabated. When not secluded
      with her at her own establishment he would be abroad with her in her trap
      or in the car of Belknap-Jackson. The owner, however, no longer drove his
      car. He had never taken another chance. And well I knew these activities
      of his lordship&rsquo;s were being basely misconstrued by the gossips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Cap is certainly some queener,&rdquo; remarked Cousin Egbert, which perhaps
      reflected the view of the deceived public at this time, the curious term
      implying that his lordship was by way of being a bit of a dog. But calm I
      remained under these aspersions, counting upon a clean-cut vindication of
      his lordship&rsquo;s methods when he should have got the woman where he wished
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remained, I repeat, serenely confident that a signal triumph would
      presently crown his lordship&rsquo;s subtly planned attack. And then, at
      midweek, I was rudely shocked to the suspicion that all might not be going
      well with his plan. I had not seen the pair for a day, and when they did
      appear for their tea I instantly detected a profound change in their
      mutual bearing. His lordship still looked at the woman, but the raillery
      of their past meetings had gone. Too plainly something momentous had
      occurred. Even the woman was serious. Had they fought to the last stand?
      Would she have been too much for him? I mean to say, was the Honourable
      George cooked?
    </p>
    <p>
      I now recalled that I had observed an almost similar change in the
      latter&rsquo;s manner. His face wore a look of wildest gloom that might have
      been mitigated perhaps by a proper trimming of his beard, but even then it
      would have been remarked by those who knew him well. I divined, I repeat,
      that something momentous had now occurred and that the Honourable George
      was one not least affected by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather a sleepless night I passed, wondering fearfully if, after all, his
      lordship would have been unable to extricate the poor chap from this
      sordid entanglement. Had the creature held out for too much? Had she
      refused to compromise? Would there be one of those appalling legal things
      which our best families so often suffer? What if the victim were to cut
      off home?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was my trepidation allayed by the cryptic remark of Mrs. Judson as I
      passed her at her tasks in the pantry that morning:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prince in his palace not too good&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I said!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shot the thing at me with a manner suspiciously near to flippancy. I
      sternly demanded her meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean what I mean,&rdquo; she retorted, shutting her lips upon it in a
      definite way she has. Well enough I knew the import of her uncivil speech,
      but I resolved not to bandy words with her, because in my position it
      would be undignified; because, further, of an unfortunate effect she has
      upon my temper at such times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s being terrible careful about <i>her</i> associates,&rdquo; she presently
      went on, with a most irritating effect of addressing only herself;
      &ldquo;nothing at all but just dukes and earls and lords day in and day out!&rdquo;
       Too often when the woman seems to wish it she contrives to get me in
      motion, as the American saying is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is deeply to be regretted,&rdquo; I replied with dignity, &ldquo;that other
      persons must say less of themselves if put to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well she knew what I meant. Despite my previous clear warning, she had
      more than once accepted small gifts from the cattle-persons, Hank and
      Buck, and had even been seen brazenly in public with them at a cinema
      palace. One of a more suspicious nature than I might have guessed that she
      conducted herself thus for the specific purpose of enraging me, but I am
      glad to say that no nature could be more free than mine from vulgar
      jealousy, and I spoke now from the mere wish that she should more
      carefully guard her reputation. As before, she exhibited a surprising
      meekness under this rebuke, though I uneasily wondered if there might not
      be guile beneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I help it,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;if they like to show me attentions? I guess
      I&rsquo;m a free woman.&rdquo; She lifted her head to observe a glass she had
      polished. Her eyes were curiously lighted. She had this way of
      embarrassing me. And invariably, moreover, she aroused all that is evil in
      my nature against the two cattle-persons, especially the Buck one,
      actually on another occasion professing admiration for &ldquo;his wavy chestnut
      hair!&rdquo; I saw now that I could not trust myself to speak of the fellow. I
      took up another matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That baby of yours is too horribly fat,&rdquo; I said suddenly. I had long
      meant to put this to her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too fat. It eats too much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To my amazement the creature was transformed into a vixen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;it! Too fat! You call my boy &lsquo;it&rsquo; and say he&rsquo;s too fat! Don&rsquo;t
      you dare! What does a creature like you know of babies? Why, you wouldn&rsquo;t
      even know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the thing was too painful. Let her angry words be forgotten. Suffice
      to say, she permitted herself to cry out things that might have given
      grave offence to one less certain of himself than I. Rather chilled I
      admit I was by her frenzied outburst. I was shrewd enough to see instantly
      that anything in the nature of a criticism of her offspring must be led up
      to, rather; perhaps couched in less direct phrases than I had chosen.
      Fearful I was that she would burst into another torrent of rage, but to my
      amazement she all at once smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fool I am!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Kidding me, were you? Trying to make
      me mad about the baby. Well, I&rsquo;ll give you good. You did it. Yes, sir, I
      never would have thought you had a kidding streak in you&mdash;old
      glum-face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little you know me,&rdquo; I retorted, and quickly withdrew, for I was then
      more embarrassed than ever, and, besides, there were other and graver
      matters forward to depress and occupy me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my fitful sleep of the night before I had dreamed vividly that I saw
      the Honourable George being dragged shackled to the altar. I trust I am
      not superstitious, but the vision had remained with me in all its
      tormenting detail. A veiled woman had grimly awaited him as he struggled
      with his uniformed captors. I mean to say, he was being hustled along by
      two constables.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day, let me now put down, was to be a day of the most fearful shocks
      that a man of rather sensitive nervous organism has ever been called upon
      to endure. There are now lines in my face that I make no doubt showed then
      for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was a day that dragged interminably, so that I became fair off my
      head with the suspense of it, feeling that at any moment the worst might
      happen. For hours I saw no one with whom I could consult. Once I was
      almost moved to call up Belknap-Jackson, so intolerable was the menacing
      uncertainty; but this I knew bordered on hysteria, and I restrained the
      impulse with an iron will.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I wretchedly longed for a sight of Cousin Egbert or the Mixer, or even
      of the Honourable George; some one to assure me that my horrid dream of
      the night before had been a baseless fabric, as the saying is. The very
      absence of these people and of his lordship was in itself ominous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nervously I kept to a post at one of my windows where I could survey the
      street. And here at mid-day I sustained my first shock. Terrific it was.
      His lordship had emerged from the chemist&rsquo;s across the street. He paused a
      moment, as if to recall his next mission, then walked briskly off. And
      this is what I had been stupefied to note: he was clean shaven! The
      Brinstead side-whiskers were gone! Whiskers that had been worn in
      precisely that fashion by a tremendous line of the Earls of Brinstead! And
      the tenth of his line had abandoned them. As well, I thought, could he
      have defaced the Brinstead arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was plain as a pillar-box, indeed. The woman had our family at her
      mercy, and she would show no mercy. My heart sank as I pictured the
      Honourable George in her toils. My dream had been prophetic. Then I
      reflected that this very circumstance of his lordship&rsquo;s having pandered to
      her lawless whim about his beard would go to show he had not yet given up
      the fight. If the thing were hopeless I knew he would have seen her&mdash;dashed&mdash;before
      he would have relinquished it. There plainly was still hope for poor
      George. Indeed his lordship might well have planned some splendid coup;
      this defacement would be a part of his strategy, suffered in anguish for
      his ultimate triumph. Quite cheered I became at the thought. I still
      scanned the street crowd for some one who could acquaint me with
      developments I must have missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then a moment later came the call by telephone of Belknap-Jackson. I
      answered it, though with little hope than to hear more of his unending
      complaints about his lordship&rsquo;s negligence. Startled instantly I was,
      however, for his voice was stranger than I had known it even in moments of
      his acutest distress. Hoarse it was, and his words alarming but hardly
      intelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard?&mdash;My God!&mdash;Heard?&mdash;My God!&mdash;Marriage! Marriage!
      God!&rdquo; But here he broke off into the most appalling laughter&mdash;the
      blood-curdling laughter of a chained patient in a mad-house. Hardly could
      I endure it and grateful I was when I heard the line close. Even when he
      attempted vocables he had sounded quite like an inferior record on a
      phonographic machine. But I had heard enough to leave me aghast. Beyond
      doubt now the very worst had come upon our family. His lordship&rsquo;s
      tremendous sacrifice would have been all in vain. Marriage! The Honourable
      George was done for. Better had it been the typing-girl, I bitterly
      reflected. Her father had at least been a curate!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thankful enough I now was for the luncheon-hour rush: I could distract
      myself from the appalling disaster. That day I took rather more than my
      accustomed charge of the serving. I chatted with our business chaps,
      recommending the joint in the highest terms; drawing corks; seeing that
      the relish was abundantly stocked at every table. I was striving to
      forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Judson alone persisted in reminding me of the impending scandal. &ldquo;A
      prince in his palace,&rdquo; she would maliciously murmur as I encountered her.
      I think she must have observed that I was bitter, for she at last spoke
      quite amiably of our morning&rsquo;s dust-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly got my goat,&rdquo; she said in the quaint American fashion,
      &ldquo;telling me little No-no was too fat. You had me going there for a minute,
      thinking you meant it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The creature&rsquo;s name was Albert, yet she persisted in calling it &ldquo;No-no,&rdquo;
       because the child itself would thus falsely declare its name upon being
      questioned, having in some strange manner gained this impression. It was
      another matter I meant to bring to her attention, but at this crisis I had
      no heart for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My crowd left. I was again alone to muse bitterly upon our plight. Still I
      scanned the street, hoping for a sight of Cousin Egbert, who, I fancied,
      would be informed as to the wretched details. Instead, now, I saw the
      Honourable George. He walked on the opposite side of the thoroughfare, his
      manner of dejection precisely what I should have expected. Followed
      closely as usual he was by the Judson cur. A spirit of desperate mockery
      seized me. I called to Mrs. Judson, who was gathering glasses from a
      table. I indicated the pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Barker,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is dogging his footsteps.&rdquo; I mean to say, I uttered
      the words in the most solemn manner. Little the woman knew that one may
      often be moved in the most distressing moments to a jest of this sort. She
      laughed heartily, being of quick discernment. And thus jauntily did I
      carry my knowledge of the lowering cloud. But I permitted myself no
      further sallies of that sort. I stayed expectantly by the window, and I
      dare say my bearing would have deceived the most alert. I was steadily
      calm. The situation called precisely for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours sped darkly and my fears mounted. In sheer desperation, at
      length, I had myself put through to Belknap-Jackson. To my astonishment he
      seemed quite revived, though in a state of feverish gayety. He fair
      bubbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just leaving this moment with his lordship to gather up some friends. We
      meet at your place. Yes, yes&mdash;all the uncertainty is past. Better set
      up that largest table&mdash;rather a celebration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Almost more confusing it was than his former message, which had been
      confined to calls upon his Maker and to maniac laughter. Was he, I
      wondered, merely making the best of it? Had he resolved to be a dead
      sportsman? A few moments later he discharged his lordship at my door and
      drove rapidly on. (Only a question of time it is when he will be had
      heavily for damages due to his reckless driving.)
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship bustled in with a cheerfulness that staggered me. He, too,
      was gay; almost debonair. A gardenia was in his lapel. He was vogue to the
      last detail in a form-fitting gray morning-suit that had all the style
      essentials. Almost it seemed as if three valets had been needed to groom
      him. He briskly rubbed his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Biggest table&mdash;people. Tea, that sort of thing. Have a go of
      champagne, too, what, what! Beard off, much younger appearing? Of course,
      course! Trust women, those matters. Tea cake, toast, crumpets, marmalade&mdash;things
      like that. Plenty champagne! Not happen every day! Ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To my acute distress he here thumbed me in the ribs and laughed again. Was
      he, too, I wondered, madly resolved to be a dead sportsman in the face of
      the unavoidable? I sought to edge in a discreet word of condolence, for I
      knew that between us there need be no pretence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you did your best, sir,&rdquo; I observed. &ldquo;And I was never quite free
      of a fear that the woman would prove too many for us. I trust the
      Honourable George&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I had said as much as he would let me. He interrupted me with his
      thumb again, and on his face was what in a lesser person I should
      unhesitatingly have called a leer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dog, you! Woman prove too many for us, what, what! Dare say you knew
      what to expect. Silly old George! Though how she could ever have fancied
      the juggins&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was about to remark that the creature had of course played her game from
      entirely sordid motives and I should doubtless have ventured to applaud
      the game spirit in which he was taking the blow. But before I could shape
      my phrases on this delicate ground Mrs. Effie, the Senator, and Cousin
      Egbert arrived. They somewhat formally had the air of being expected. All
      of them rushed upon his lordship with an excessive manner. Apparently they
      were all to be dead sportsmen together. And then Mrs. Effie called me
      aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do me a favour,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;About the wedding breakfast and
      reception. Dear Kate&rsquo;s place is so small. It wouldn&rsquo;t do. There will be a
      crush, of course. I&rsquo;ve had the loveliest idea for it&mdash;our own house.
      You know how delighted we&rsquo;d be. The Earl has been so charming and
      everything has turned out so splendidly. Oh, I&rsquo;d love to do them this
      little parting kindness. Use your influence like a good fellow, won&rsquo;t you,
      when the thing is suggested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only too gladly,&rdquo; I responded, sick at heart, and she returned to the
      group. Well I knew her motive. She was by way of getting even with the
      Belknap-Jacksons. As Cousin Egbert in his American fashion would put it,
      she was trying to pass them a bison. But I was willing enough she should
      house the dreadful affair. The more private the better, thought I.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Belknap-Jackson&rsquo;s car appeared at my door, now discharging
      the Klondike woman, effusively escorted by the Mixer and by Mrs.
      Belknap-Jackson. The latter at least, I had thought, would show more
      principle. But she had buckled atrociously, quite as had her husband, who
      had quickly, almost merrily, followed them. There was increased gayety as
      they seated themselves about the large table, a silly noise of pretended
      felicitation over a calamity that not even the tenth Earl of Brinstead had
      been able to avert. And then Belknap-Jackson beckoned me aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want your help, old chap, in case it&rsquo;s needed,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wedding breakfast and reception?&rdquo; I said quite cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve thought of it? Good! Her own place is far too small. Crowd, of
      course. And it&rsquo;s rather proper at our place, too, his lordship having been
      our house guest. You see? Use what influence you have. The affair will be
      rather widely commented on&mdash;even the New York papers, I dare say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count upon me,&rdquo; I answered blandly, even as I had promised Mrs. Effie.
      Disgusted I was. Let them maul each other about over the wretched
      &ldquo;honour.&rdquo; They could all be dead sports if they chose, but I was now
      firmly resolved that for myself I should make not a bit of pretence. The
      creature might trick poor George into a marriage, but I for one would not
      affect to regard it as other than a blight upon our house. I was just on
      the point of hoping that the victim himself might have cut off to unknown
      parts when I saw him enter. By the other members of the party he was
      hailed with cries of delight, though his own air was finely honest, being
      dejected in the extreme. He was dressed as regrettably as usual, this time
      in parts of two lounge-suits.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he joined those at the table I constrained myself to serve the
      champagne. Senator Floud arose with a brimming glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he began in his public-speaking manner, &ldquo;let us remember
      that Red Gap&rsquo;s loss is England&rsquo;s gain&mdash;to the future Countess of
      Brinstead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To my astonishment this appalling breach of good taste was received with
      the loudest applause, nor was his lordship the least clamorous of them. I
      mean to say, the chap had as good as wished that his lordship would
      directly pop off. It was beyond me. I walked to the farthest window and
      stood a long time gazing pensively out; I wished to be away from that
      false show. But they noticed my absence at length and called to me.
      Monstrously I was desired to drink to the happiness of the groom. I
      thought they were pressing me too far, but as they quite gabbled now with
      their tea and things, I hoped to pass it off. The Senator, however, seemed
      to fasten me with his eye as he proposed the toast&mdash;&ldquo;To the happy
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drank perforce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A body would think Bill was drinking to the Judge,&rdquo; remarked Cousin
      Egbert in a high voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; I said, startled to this outburst by his strange words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old George!&rdquo; exclaimed his lordship. &ldquo;Owe it all to the old juggins,
      what, what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Klondike person spoke. I heard her voice as a bell pealing through
      breakers at sea. I mean to say, I was now fair dazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to old George,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;To old Ruggles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To old Ruggles!&rdquo; promptly cried the Senator, and they drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muddled indeed I was. Again in my eventful career I felt myself tremble; I
      knew not what I should say, any <i>savoir faire</i> being quite gone. I
      had received a crumpler of some sort&mdash;but what <i>sort?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      My sleeve was touched. I turned blindly, as in a nightmare. The Hobbs cub
      who was my vestiare was handing me our evening paper. I took it from him,
      staring&mdash;staring until my knees grew weak. Across the page in clarion
      type rang the unbelievable words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    BRITISH PEER WINS AMERICAN BRIDE

    His Lordship Tenth Earl of Brinstead to Wed One of Red Gap&rsquo;s
    Fairest Daughters
</pre>
    <p>
      My hands so shook that in quick subterfuge I dropped the sheet, then
      stooped for it, trusting to control myself before I again raised my face.
      Mercifully the others were diverted by the journal. It was seized from me,
      passed from hand to hand, the incredible words read aloud by each in turn.
      They jested of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amazing chaps, your pressmen!&rdquo; Thus the tenth Earl of Brinstead, while I
      pinched myself viciously to bring back my lost aplomb. &ldquo;Speedy beggars,
      what, what! Never knew it myself till last night. She would and she
      wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you knew,&rdquo; said the lady. Stricken as I was I noted that she eyed
      him rather strangely, quite as if she felt some decent respect for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marriage is serious,&rdquo; boomed the Mixer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame her, don&rsquo;t blame her&mdash;swear I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; returned his
      lordship. &ldquo;Few days to think it over&mdash;quite right, quite right. Got
      to know their own minds, my word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While their attention was thus mercifully diverted from me, my own world
      by painful degrees resumed its stability. I mean to say, I am not the
      fainting sort, but if I were, then I should have keeled over at my first
      sight of that journal. But now I merely recovered my glass of champagne
      and drained it. Rather pigged it a bit, I fancy. Badly needing a stimulant
      I was, to be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now discussed details: the ceremony&mdash;that sort of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before a registrar, quickest way,&rdquo; said his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Church, of course!&rdquo; rumbled the Mixer very arbitrarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, then,&rdquo; assented his lordship. &ldquo;Get me the rector of the parish&mdash;a
      vicar, a curate, something of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the breakfast and reception,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Effie with a meaning
      glance at me before she turned to the lady. &ldquo;Of course, dearest, your own
      tiny nest would never hold your host of friends&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never noticed,&rdquo; said the other quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always seemed big
      enough,&rdquo; she added in pensive tones and with downcast eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not large enough by half,&rdquo; put in Belknap-Jackson, &ldquo;Most charming
      little home-nook but worlds too small for all your well-wishers.&rdquo; With a
      glance at me he narrowed his eyes in friendly calculation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m somewhat
      puzzled myself&mdash;Suppose we see what the capable Ruggles has to
      suggest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Ruggles suggest something by all means!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mean to say, they both quite thought they knew what I would suggest, but
      it was nothing of the sort. The situation had entirely changed. Quite
      another sort of thing it was. Quickly I resolved to fling them both aside.
      I, too, would be a dead sportsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to suggest,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;that my place here is the only one
      at all suitable for the breakfast and reception. I can promise that the
      affair will go off smartly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two had looked up with such radiant expectation at my opening words
      and were so plainly in a state at my conclusion that I dare say the future
      Countess of Brinstead at once knew what. She flashed them a look, then
      eyed me with quick understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a hearty American manner. &ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo;
       she continued briskly, as both Belknap-Jackson and Mrs. Effie would have
      interposed &ldquo;Ruggles shall do everything: take it off our shoulders&mdash;ices,
      flowers, invitations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The invitation list will need great care, of course,&rdquo; remarked
      Belknap-Jackson with a quite savage glance at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you just called him &lsquo;the capable Ruggles,&rsquo;&rdquo; insisted the fiancée. &ldquo;We
      shall leave it all to him. How many will you ask, Ruggles?&rdquo; Her eyes
      flicked from mine to Belknap-Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite almost every one,&rdquo; I answered firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ripping!&rdquo; said his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His lordship will of course wish a best man,&rdquo; suggested Belknap-Jackson.
      &ldquo;I should be only too glad&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to suggest Ruggles again!&rdquo; cried the lady. &ldquo;Just the man for
      it! You&rsquo;re quite right. Why, we owe it all to Ruggles, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She here beamed upon his lordship. Belknap-Jackson wore an expression of
      the keenest disrelish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, course!&rdquo; replied his lordship. &ldquo;Dashed good man, Ruggles! Owe
      it all to him, what, what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I fancy in the cordial excitement of the moment he was quite sincere. As
      to her ladyship, I am to this day unable to still a faint suspicion that
      she was having me on. True, she owed it all to me. But I hadn&rsquo;t a bit
      meant it and well she knew it. Subtle she was, I dare say, but bore me no
      malice, though she was not above setting Belknap-Jackson back a pace or
      two each time he moved up.
    </p>
    <p>
      A final toast was drunk and my guests drifted out. Belknap-Jackson again
      glared savagely at me as he went, but Mrs. Effie rather outglared him.
      Even I should hardly have cared to face her at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I was still in a high state of muddle. It was all beyond me. Had his
      lordship, I wondered, too seriously taken my careless words about American
      equality? Of course I had meant them to apply only to those stopping on in
      the States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Egbert lingered to the last, rather with a troubled air of wishing
      to consult me. When I at length came up with him he held the journal
      before me, indicating lines in the article&mdash;&ldquo;relict of an Alaskan
      capitalist, now for some years one of Red Gap&rsquo;s social favourites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that there,&rdquo; he commanded grimly. Then with a terrific earnestness I
      had never before remarked in him: &ldquo;Say, listen here! I better go round
      right off and mix it up with that fresh guy. What&rsquo;s he hinting around at
      by that there word &lsquo;relict&rsquo;? Why, say, she was married to him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hastily corrected his preposterous interpretation of the word, much to
      his relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still in my precious state of muddle. Mrs. Judson took occasion to
      flounce by me in her work of clearing the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prince in his palace,&rdquo; she taunted. I laughed in a lofty manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you poor thing, I&rsquo;ve known it all for some days,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must say you&rsquo;re the deep one if you did&mdash;never letting on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was unable to repress a glance of admiration at me as she moved off.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood where she had left me, meditating profoundly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWENTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two days later at high noon was solemnized the marriage of his lordship to
      the woman who, without a bit meaning it, I had so curiously caused to
      enter his life. The day was for myself so crowded with emotions that it
      returns in rather a jumble: patches of incidents, little floating clouds
      of memory; some meaningless and one at least to be significant to my last
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceremony was had in our most nearly smart church. It was only a
      Methodist church, but I took pains to assure myself that a ceremony
      performed by its curate would be legal. I still seem to hear the organ,
      strains of &ldquo;The Voice That Breathed Through Eden,&rdquo; as we neared the altar;
      also the Mixer&rsquo;s rumbling whisper about a lost handkerchief which she
      apparently found herself needing at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The responses of bride and groom were unhesitating, even firm. Her
      ladyship, I thought, had never appeared to better advantage than in the
      pearl-tinted lustreless going-away gown she had chosen. As always, she had
      finely known what to put on her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Floud, despite Belknap-Jackson&rsquo;s suggestion of himself for the
      office, had been selected to give away the bride, as the saying is. He
      performed his function with dignity, though I recall being seized with
      horror when the moment came; almost certain I am he restrained himself
      with difficulty from making a sort of a speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church was thronged. I had seen to that. I had told her ladyship that
      I should ask quite almost every one, and this I had done, squarely in the
      face of Belknap-Jackson&rsquo;s pleading that discretion be used. For a great
      white light, as one might say, had now suffused me. I had seen that the
      moment was come when the warring factions of Red Gap should be reunited. A
      Bismarck I felt myself, indeed. That I acted ably was later to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even for the wedding breakfast, which occurred directly after the
      ceremony, I had shown myself a dictator in the matter of guests. Covers
      were laid in my room for seventy and among these were included not only
      the members of the North Side set and the entire Bohemian set, but many
      worthy persons not hitherto socially existent yet who had been friends or
      well-wishers of the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am persuaded to confess that in a few of these instances I was not above
      a snarky little wish to correct the social horizon of Belknap-Jackson; to
      make it more broadly accord, as I may say, with the spirit of American
      equality for which their forefathers bled and died on the battlefields of
      Boston, New York, and Vicksburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not the least of my reward, then, was to see his eyebrows more than once
      eloquently raise, as when the cattle-persons, Hank and Buck, appeared in
      suits of decent black, or when the driver chap Pierce entered with his
      quite obscure mother on his arm, or a few other cattle and horse persons
      with whom the Honourable George had palled up during his process of going
      in for America.
    </p>
    <p>
      This laxity I felt that the Earl of Brinstead and his bride could amply
      afford, while for myself I had soundly determined that Red Gap should
      henceforth be without &ldquo;sets.&rdquo; I mean to say, having frankly taken up
      America, I was at last resolved to do it whole-heartedly. If I could not
      take up the whole of it, I would not take up a part. Quite instinctively I
      had chosen the slogan of our Chamber of Commerce: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Knock&mdash;Boost;
      and Boost Altogether.&rdquo; Rudely worded though it is, I had seen it to be
      sound in spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts ran in my mind during the smart repast that now followed.
      Insidiously I wrought among the guests to amalgamate into one friendly
      whole certain elements that had hitherto been hostile. The Bohemian set
      was not segregated. Almost my first inspiration had been to scatter its
      members widely among the conservative pillars of the North Side set. Left
      in one group, I had known they would plume themselves quite intolerably
      over the signal triumph of their leader; perhaps, in the American speech,
      &ldquo;start something.&rdquo; Widely scattered, they became mere parts of the whole I
      was seeking to achieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banquet progressed gayly to its finish. Toasts were drunk no end, all
      of them proposed by Senator Floud who, toward the last, kept almost
      constantly on his feet. From the bride and groom he expanded
      geographically through Red Gap, the Kulanche Valley, the State of
      Washington, and the United States to the British Empire, not omitting the
      Honourable George&mdash;who, I noticed, called for the relish and consumed
      quite almost an entire bottle during the meal. Also I was proposed&mdash;&ldquo;through
      whose lifelong friendship for the illustrious groom this meeting of hearts
      and hands has been so happily brought about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship&rsquo;s eyes rested briefly upon mine as her lips touched the glass
      to this. They conveyed the unspeakable. Rather a fool I felt, and unable
      to look away until she released me. She had been wondrously quiet through
      it all. Not dazed in the least, as might have been looked for in one of
      her lowly station thus prodigiously elevated; and not feverishly gay, as
      might also have been anticipated. Simple and quiet she was, showing a
      complete but perfectly controlled awareness of her position.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time then, I think, I did envision her as the Countess of
      Brinstead. She was going to carry it off. Perhaps quite as well as even I
      could have wished his lordship&rsquo;s chosen mate to do. I observed her look at
      his lordship with those strange lights in her eyes, as if only half
      realizing yet wholly believing all that he believed. And once at the
      height of the gayety I saw her reach out to touch his sleeve, furtively,
      swiftly, and so gently he never knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me there were things about the woman we had taken too
      little trouble to know. I wondered what old memories might be coming to
      her now; what staring faces might obtrude, what old, far-off, perhaps
      hated, voices might be sounding to her; what of remembered hurts and
      heartaches might newly echo back to make her flinch and wonder if she
      dreamed. She touched the sleeve again, as it might have been in protection
      from them, her eyes narrowed, her gaze fixed. It queerly occurred to me
      that his lordship might find her as difficult to know as we had&mdash;and
      yet would keep always trying more than we had, to be sure. I mean to say,
      she was no gabbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      The responses to the Senator&rsquo;s toasts increased in volume. His final
      flight, I recall, involved terms like &ldquo;our blood-cousins of the British
      Isles,&rdquo; and introduced a figure of speech about &ldquo;hands across the sea,&rdquo;
       which I thought striking, indeed. The applause aroused by this was noisy
      in the extreme, a number of the cattle and horse persons, including the
      redskin Tuttle, emitting a shrill, concerted &ldquo;yipping&rdquo; which, though it
      would never have done with us, seemed somehow not out of place in North
      America, although I observed Belknap-Jackson to make gestures of extreme
      repugnance while it lasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      There ensued a rather flurried wishing of happiness to the pair. A novel
      sight it was, the most austere matrons of the North Side set vying for
      places in the line that led past them. I found myself trying to analyze
      the inner emotions of some of them I best knew as they fondly greeted the
      now radiant Countess of Brinstead. But that way madness lay, as
      Shakespeare has so aptly said of another matter. I recalled, though, the
      low-toned comment of Cousin Egbert, who stood near me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t them dames stand the gaff noble!&rdquo; It was quite true. They were
      heroic. I recalled then his other quaint prophecy that her ladyship would
      hand them a bottle of lemonade. As is curiously usual with this simple
      soul, he had gone to the heart of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The throng dwindled to the more intimate friends. Among those who lingered
      were the Belknap-Jacksons and Mrs. Effie. Quite solicitous they were for
      the &ldquo;dear Countess,&rdquo; as they rather defiantly called her to one another.
      Belknap-Jackson casually mentioned in my hearing that he had been asked to
      Chaynes-Wotten for the shooting. Mrs. Effie, who also heard, swiftly
      remarked that she would doubtless run over in the spring&mdash;the dear
      Earl was so insistent. They rather glared at each other. But in truth his
      lordship had insisted that quite almost every one should come and stop on
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, course, what, what! Jolly party, no end of fun. Week-end, that
      sort of thing. Know she&rsquo;ll like her old friends best. Wouldn&rsquo;t be keen for
      the creature if she&rsquo;d not. Have &lsquo;em all, have &lsquo;em all. Capital, by Jove!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To be sure it was a manner of speaking, born of the expansive good feeling
      of the moment. Yet I believe Cousin Egbert was the only invited one to
      decline. He did so with evident distress at having to refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like your little woman a whole lot,&rdquo; he observed to his lordship, &ldquo;but
      Europe is too kind of uncomfortable for me; keeps me upset all the time,
      what with all the foreigners and one thing and another. But, listen here,
      Cap! You pack the little woman back once in a while. Just to give us a
      flash at her. We&rsquo;ll give you both a good time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ho!&rdquo; returned his lordship. &ldquo;Of course, course! Fancy we&rsquo;d like it
      vastly, what, what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I fancy you would, too,&rdquo; and rather startlingly Cousin Egbert
      seized her ladyship and kissed her heartily. Whereupon her ladyship kissed
      the fellow in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I dare say I fancy you would,&rdquo; he called back a bit nervously
      as he left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belknap-Jackson drove the party to the station, feeling, I am sure, that
      he scored over Mrs. Effie, though he was obliged to include the Mixer,
      from whom her ladyship bluntly refused to be separated. I inferred that
      she must have found the time and seclusion in which to weep a bit on the
      Mixer&rsquo;s shoulder. The waist of the latter&rsquo;s purple satin gown was quite
      spotty at the height of her ladyship&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belknap-Jackson on this occasion drove his car with the greatest
      solicitude, proceeding more slowly than I had ever known him do. As I
      attended to certain luggage details at the station he was regretting to
      his lordship that they had not had a longer time at the country club the
      day it was exhibited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look a bit after silly old George,&rdquo; said his lordship to me at parting.
      &ldquo;Chap&rsquo;s dotty, I dare say. Talking about a plantation of apple trees now.
      For his old age&mdash;that sort of thing. Be something new in a fortnight,
      though. Like him, of course, course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship closed upon my hand with a remarkable vigour of grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We owe it all to you,&rdquo; she said, again with dancing eyes. Then her eyes
      steadied queerly. &ldquo;Maybe you won&rsquo;t be sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know I shan&rsquo;t.&rdquo; I fancy I rather growled it, stupidly feeling I was not
      rising to the occasion. &ldquo;Knew his lordship wouldn&rsquo;t rest till he had you
      where he wanted you. Glad he&rsquo;s got you.&rdquo; And curiously I felt a bit of a
      glad little squeeze in my throat for her. I groped for something light&mdash;something
      American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are some Countess,&rdquo; I at last added in a silly way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, what!&rdquo; said his lordship, but I had caught her eyes. They brimmed
      with understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the going of that train all life seemed to go. I mean to say, things
      all at once became flat. I turned to the dull station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give you a lift, old chap,&rdquo; said Belknap-Jackson. Again he was cordial.
      So firmly had I kept the reins of the whole affair in my grasp, such
      prestige he knew it would give me, he dared not broach his grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some half-remembered American phrase of Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s ran in my mind. I
      had put a buffalo on him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m needing a bit of a stretch and a breeze-out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wished to walk that I might the better meditate. With Belknap-Jackson
      one does not sufficiently meditate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A block up from the station I was struck by the sight of the Honourable
      George. Plodding solitary down that low street he was, heeled as usual by
      the Judson cur. He came to the Spilmer public house and for a moment
      stared up, quite still, at the &ldquo;Last Chance&rdquo; on its chaffing signboard.
      Then he wheeled abruptly and entered. I was moved to follow him, but I
      knew it would never do. He would row me about the service of the Grill&mdash;something
      of that sort. I dare say he had fancied her ladyship as keenly as one of
      his volatile nature might. But I knew him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Back on our street the festival atmosphere still lingered. Groups of
      recent guests paused to discuss the astounding event. The afternoon paper
      was being scanned by many of them. An account of the wedding was its
      &ldquo;feature,&rdquo; as they say. I had no heart for that, but on the second page my
      eye caught a minor item:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;A special meeting of the Ladies Onwards and Upwards Club is
    called for to-morrow afternoon at two sharp at the residence
    of Mrs. Dr. Percy Hailey Martingale, for the transaction of
    important business.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      One could fancy, I thought, what the meeting would discuss. Nor was I
      wrong, for I may here state that the evening paper of the following day
      disclosed that her ladyship the Countess of Brinstead had unanimously been
      elected to a life honorary membership in the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the Grill I found the work of clearing the tables well advanced,
      and very soon its before-dinner aspect of calm waiting was restored.
      Surveying it I reflected that one might well wonder if aught momentous had
      indeed so lately occurred here. A motley day it had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed into the linen and glass pantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Judson, polishing my glassware, burst into tears at my approach,
      frankly stanching them with her towel. I saw it to be a mere overflow of
      the meaningless emotion that women stock so abundantly on the occasion of
      a wedding. She is an almost intensely feminine person, as can be seen at
      once by any one who understands women. In a goods box in the passage
      beyond I noted her nipper fast asleep, a mammoth beef-rib clasped to its
      fat chest. I debated putting this abuse to her once more but feared the
      moment was not propitious. She dried her eyes and smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prince in his palace,&rdquo; she murmured inanely. &ldquo;She thought first he was
      going to be as funny as the other one; then she found he wasn&rsquo;t. I liked
      him, too. I didn&rsquo;t blame her a bit. He&rsquo;s one of that kind&mdash;his bark&rsquo;s
      worse than his bite. And to think you knew all the time what was coming
      off. My, but you&rsquo;re the Mr. Deep-one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw no reason to stultify myself by denying this. I mean to say, if she
      thought it, let her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last thing yesterday she gave me this dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had already noted the very becoming dull blue house gown she wore. Quite
      with an air she carried it. To be sure, it was not suitable to her duties.
      The excitements of the day, I suppose, had rendered me a bit sterner than
      is my wont. Perhaps a little authoritative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A handsome gown,&rdquo; I replied icily, &ldquo;but one would hardly choose it for
      the work you are performing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; she retorted plainly. &ldquo;I wanted to look nice&mdash;I had to go
      in there lots of times. And I wanted to be dressed for to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why to-night, may I ask?&rdquo; I was all at once uncomfortably curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the boys are coming for me. They&rsquo;re going to take No-no home, then
      we&rsquo;re all going to the movies. They&rsquo;ve got a new bill at the Bijou, and
      Buck Edwards especially wants me to see it. One of the cowboys in it that
      does some star riding looks just like Buck&mdash;wavy chestnut hair. Buck
      himself is one of the best riders in the whole Kulanche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman seemed to have some fiendish power to enrage me. As she prattled
      thus, her eyes demurely on the glass she dried, I felt a deep flush mantle
      my brow. She could never have dreamed that she had this malign power, but
      she was now at least to suspect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Mr. Edwards,&rdquo; I began calmly enough, &ldquo;may be like the cinema actor:
      the two may be as like each other as makes no difference&mdash;but you are
      not going.&rdquo; I was aware that the latter phrase was heated where I had
      merely meant it to be impressive. Dignified firmness had been the line I
      intended, but my rage was mounting. She stared at me. Astonished beyond
      words she was, if I can read human expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am!&rdquo; she snapped at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not!&rdquo; I repeated, stepping a bit toward her. I was conscious of a
      bit of the rowdy in my manner, but I seemed powerless to prevent it. All
      my culture was again but the flimsiest veneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, too!&rdquo; she again said, though plainly dismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; I quite thundered it, I dare say. &ldquo;No, no! No, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nipper cried out from his box. Not until later did it occur to me that
      he had considered himself to be addressed in angry tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; I thundered again. I couldn&rsquo;t help myself, though silly rot I
      call it now. And then to my horror the mother herself began to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;I will! I will! I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; I insisted, and I found myself seizing her shoulders, not
      knowing if I mightn&rsquo;t shake her smartly, so drawn-out had the woman got
      me; and still I kept shouting my senseless &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; at which the nipper
      was now yelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      She struggled her best as I clutched her, but I seemed to have the
      strength of a dozen men; the woman was nothing in my grasp, and my arms
      were taking their blind rage out on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secure I held her, and presently she no longer struggled, and I was
      curiously no longer angry, but found myself soothing her in many strange
      ways. I mean to say, the passage between us had fallen to be of the very
      shockingly most sentimental character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so masterful!&rdquo; she panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have my own way,&rdquo; I threatened; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you often enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re so domineering!&rdquo; she murmured. I dare say I am a bit that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you who&rsquo;s to be master!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I never dreamed you meant this,&rdquo; she answered. True, I had most
      brutally taken her by surprise. I could easily see how, expecting nothing
      of the faintest sort, she had been rudely shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant it all along,&rdquo; I said firmly, &ldquo;from the very first moment.&rdquo; And
      now again she spoke in almost awed tones of my &ldquo;deepness.&rdquo; I have never
      believed in that excessive intuition which is so widely boasted for woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never dreamed of it,&rdquo; she said again, and added: &ldquo;Mrs. Kenner and I
      were talking about this dress only last night and I said&mdash;I never,
      never dreamed of such a thing!&rdquo; She broke off with sudden inconsequence,
      as women will.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had now to quiet the nipper in his box. I saw even then that,
      domineering though I may be, I should probably never care to bring the
      child&rsquo;s condition to her notice again. There was something about her&mdash;something
      volcanic in her femininity. I knew it would never do. Better let the thing
      continue to be a monstrosity! I might, unnoticed, of course, snatch a bun
      from its grasp now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our evening rush came and went quite as if nothing had happened. I may
      have been rather absent, reflecting pensively. I mean to say, I had at
      times considered this alliance as a dawning possibility, but never had I
      meant to be sudden. Only for the woman&rsquo;s remarkably stubborn obtuseness I
      dare say the understanding might have been deferred to a more suitable
      moment and arranged in a calm and orderly manner. But the die was cast.
      Like his lordship, I had chosen an American bride&mdash;taken her by storm
      and carried her off her feet before she knew it. We English are often that
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock we closed the Grill upon a day that had been historic in
      the truest sense of the word. I shouldered the sleeping nipper. He still
      passionately clutched the beef-rib and for some reason I felt averse to
      depriving him of it, even though it would mean a spotty top-coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough, we talked but little in our walk. It seemed rather too
      tremendous to talk of.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I gave the child into her arms at the door it had become half awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruggums!&rdquo; it muttered sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruggums!&rdquo; echoed the mother, and again, very softly in the still night:
      &ldquo;Ruggums&mdash;Ruggums!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That in the few months since that rather agreeable night I have acquired
      the title of Red Gap&rsquo;s social dictator cannot be denied. More than one
      person of discernment may now be heard to speak of my &ldquo;reign,&rdquo; though
      this, of course, is coming it a bit thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The removal by his lordship of one who, despite her sterling qualities,
      had been a source of discord, left the social elements of the town in a
      state of the wildest disorganization. And having for myself acquired a
      remarkable prestige from my intimate association with the affair, I
      promptly seized the reins and drew the scattered forces together.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, at an early day I sought an interview with Belknap-Jackson and Mrs.
      Effie and told them straight precisely why I had played them both false in
      the matter of the wedding breakfast. With the honour granted to either of
      them, I explained, I had foreseen another era of cliques, divisions, and
      acrimony. Therefore I had done the thing myself, as a measure of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flatly then I declared my intention of reconciling all those formerly
      opposed elements and of creating a society in Red Gap that would be a
      social union in the finest sense of the word. I said that contact with
      their curious American life had taught me that their equality should be
      more than a name, and that, especially in the younger settlements, a
      certain relaxation from the rigid requirements of an older order is not
      only unavoidable but vastly to be desired. I meant to say, if we were
      going to be Americans it was silly rot trying to be English at the same
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pointed out that their former social leaders had ever been inspired by
      the idea of exclusion; the soul of their leadership had been to cast
      others out; and that the campaign I planned was to be one of inclusion&mdash;even
      to the extent of Bohemians and well-behaved cattle-persons&mdash;-which I
      believed to be in the finest harmony with their North American theory of
      human association. It might be thought a naïve theory, I said, but so long
      as they had chosen it I should staunchly abide by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I added what I dare say they did not believe: that the position of leader
      was not one I should cherish for any other reason than the public good.
      That when one better fitted might appear they would find me the first to
      rejoice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need not say that I was interrupted frequently and acridly during this
      harangue, but I had given them both a buffalo and well they knew it. And I
      worked swiftly from that moment. I gave the following week the first of a
      series of subscription balls in the dancing hall above the Grill, and both
      Mrs. Belknap-Jackson and Mrs. Effie early enrolled themselves as
      patronesses, even after I had made it plain that I alone should name the
      guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of the affair was all I could have wished. Red Gap had become
      a social unit. Nor was appreciation for my leadership wanting. There will
      be malcontents, I foresee, and from the informed inner circles I learn
      that I have already been slightingly spoken of as a foreigner wielding a
      sceptre over native-born Americans, but I have the support of quite all
      who really matter, and I am confident these rebellions may be put down by
      tact alone. It is too well understood by those who know me that I have
      Equality for my watchword.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mean to say, at the next ball of the series I may even see that the
      fellow Hobbs has a card if I can become assured that he has quite freed
      himself from certain debasing class-ideals of his native country. This to
      be sure is an extreme case, because the fellow is that type of our serving
      class to whom equality is unthinkable. They must, from their centuries of
      servility, look either up or down; and I scarce know in which attitude
      they are more offensive to our American point of view. Still I mean to be
      broad. Even Hobbs shall have his chance with us!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is late June. Mrs. Ruggles and I are comfortably installed in her
      enlarged and repaired house. We have a fowl-run on a stretch of her
      free-hold, and the kitchen-garden thrives under the care of the Japanese
      agricultural labourer I have employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already I have discharged more than half my debt to Cousin Egbert, who
      exclaims, &ldquo;Oh, shucks!&rdquo; each time I make him a payment. He and the
      Honourable George remain pally no end and spend much of their abundant
      leisure at Cousin Egbert&rsquo;s modest country house. At times when they are in
      town they rather consort with street persons, but such is the breadth of
      our social scheme that I shall never exclude them from our gayeties,
      though it is true that more often than not they decline to be present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ruggles, I may say, is a lady of quite amazing capacities combined
      strangely with the commonest feminine weaknesses. She has acute business
      judgment at most times, yet would fly at me in a rage if I were to say
      what I think of the nipper&rsquo;s appalling grossness. Quite naturally I do not
      push my unquestioned mastery to this extreme. There are other matters in
      which I amusedly let her have her way, though she fondly reminds me almost
      daily of my brutal self-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one point I have just been obliged to assert this. She came running to
      me with a suggestion for economizing in the manufacture of the relish. She
      had devised a cheaper formula. But I was firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as the inventor&rsquo;s face is on that flask,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;its contents
      shall not be debased a tuppence. My name and face will guarantee its
      purity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave in nicely, merely declaring that I needn&rsquo;t growl like one of
      their bears with a painful foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      At my carefully mild suggestion she has just brought the nipper in from
      where he was cattying the young fowls, much to their detriment. But she is
      now heaping compote upon a slice of thickly buttered bread for him,
      glancing meanwhile at our evening newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruggums always has his awful own way, doesn&rsquo;t ums?&rdquo; she remarks to the
      nipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deeply ignoring this, I resume my elocutionary studies of the Declaration
      of Independence. For I should say that a signal honour of a municipal
      character has just been done me. A committee of the Chamber of Commerce
      has invited me to participate in their exercises on an early day in July&mdash;the
      fourth, I fancy&mdash;when they celebrate the issuance of this famous
      document. I have been asked to read it, preceding a patriotic address to
      be made by Senator Floud.
    </p>
    <p>
      I accepted with the utmost pleasure, and now on my vine-sheltered porch
      have begun trying it out for the proper voice effects. Its substance, I
      need not say, is already familiar to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nipper is horribly gulping at its food, jam smears quite all about its
      countenance. Mrs. Ruggles glances over her journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you like it,&rdquo; she suddenly demands, &ldquo;if I went around town like
      these English women&mdash;burning churches and houses of Parliament and
      cutting up fine oil paintings. How would that suit your grouchy highness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not England,&rdquo; I answer shortly. &ldquo;That sort of thing would never
      do with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My, but isn&rsquo;t he the fierce old Ruggums!&rdquo; she cries in affected alarm to
      the now half-suffocated nipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more I take up the Declaration of Independence. It lends itself
      rather well to reciting. I feel that my voice is going to carry.
    </p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
